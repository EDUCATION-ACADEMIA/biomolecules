<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-DNA replication is semiconservative, meaning that each strand in the DNA double helix acts as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. This process takes us from one starting molecule to two “daughter” molecules, with each newly formed double helix containing one new and one old strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In DNA replication, the two strands are unwound from one another. A molecule called DNA polymerase runs the length of each strand, making a complementary copy of each strand. In other words, each strand acts as a blueprint to produce a complementary strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In both cases, replication occurs so quickly because multiple polymerases can synthesize two new strands at the same time by using each unwound strand from the original DNA double helix as a template. One of these original strands is called the leading strand, whereas the other is called the lagging strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as semiconservative replication.
