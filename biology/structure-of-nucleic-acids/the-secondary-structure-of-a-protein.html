<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another. Images showing hydrogen bonding patterns in beta pleated sheets and alpha helices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures such as the alpha helix.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The tertiary structure is the overall shape of the polypeptide that results from interactions and hydrogen bonding between the side chains, or R groups, of the various amino acids present. It is during this stage of protein formation that disulfide bridges and hydrophobic interactions are first seen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Secondary structure refers to regular, local structure of the protein backbone, stabilised by intramolecular and sometimes intermolecular hydrogen bonding of amide groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The R groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide protrude out from the -helix chain. In the -pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of the pleat.
