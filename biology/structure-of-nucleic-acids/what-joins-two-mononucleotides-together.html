<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The first ester bond already exists between the phosphate group and the 5’ carbon of the pentose sugar of the nucleotide. The second ester bond is formed between the hydroxyl group (–OH) attached to the 3’ carbon of the preceding sugar molecule and the phosphate group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Thus, phosphate and pentose sugars of DNA are joined by phosphodiester linkage; the correct answer is B.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar is an ester bond. DNA and RNA are composed of nucleotides that are linked to one another in a chain by chemical bonds, called ester bonds. Between the sugar base of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the adjacent nucleotide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is a very strong covalent bond. Two or more nucleotides are attached to one another via the phosphodiester bond. A phosphodiester bond is formed between two nucleotides when the phosphate group of one nucleotide reacts with the hydroxyl group present at the third carbon of another nucleotide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-DNA is a polymer of nucleotides which are linked to each other by 3-5 phosphodiester bond.
