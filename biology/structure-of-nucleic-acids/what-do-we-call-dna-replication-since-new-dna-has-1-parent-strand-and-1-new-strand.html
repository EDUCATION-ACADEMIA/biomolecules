<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Thus after every round of replication, there are two DNA molecules produced where each of them have a single parental and a newly synthesized strand. Since only one out of the two parents is conserved between the two strands, it is called semiconservative DNA replication.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as semiconservative replication.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-DNA replication is semiconservative, meaning that each strand in the DNA double helix acts as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. This process takes us from one starting molecule to two “daughter” molecules, with each newly formed double helix containing one new and one old strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The semi-conservative method of replication suggests that the two parental DNA strands serve as a template for new DNA and after replication, each double-stranded DNA contains one strand from the parental DNA and one new (daughter) strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The leading strand is the strand of new DNA which is synthesized in the same direction as the growing replication fork.
