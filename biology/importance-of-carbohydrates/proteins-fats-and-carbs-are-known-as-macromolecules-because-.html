<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Macronutrients, or macros, are essential nutrients the body needs in large quantities to remain healthy. Macronutrients provide the body with energy, help prevent disease, and allow the body to function correctly. There are three main types of macronutrients: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, fat and protein are called macronutrients. They are the nutrients you use in the largest amounts. “Macronutrients are the nutritive components of food that the body needs for energy and to maintain the body’s structure and systems, ” says MD Anderson Wellness Dietitian Lindsey Wohlford.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Gigantic molecules, called macromolecules, populate a cell and provide it with important functions for life. For example, macromolecules provide structural support, a source of stored fuel, the ability to store and retrieve genetic information, and the ability to speed biochemical reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Macronutrients are the nutrients your body needs in larger amounts, namely carbohydrates, protein, and fat. These provide your body with energy, or calories. Micronutrients are the nutrients your body needs in smaller amounts, which are commonly referred to as vitamins and minerals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The “big 3” macronutrients (macros) are fats, carbohydrates and protein. When eaten in the right ratios, these three macronutrients can improve your weight, health and overall physical well-being.
