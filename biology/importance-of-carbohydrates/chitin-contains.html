<title>Chitin contains
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). These units form covalent β-(1→4)-linkages (like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose).Chitin is made up of modified glucose monosaccharides. Glucose exists as a ring of carbon and oxygen molecules. Bonds between glucose molecules are known as glycosidic bonds. The oxygens that typically form hydroxyl groups bonded to the carbon ring can also form a bond with another carbon instead of a hydrogen.The main natural sources of chitin are shrimp and crab shells, which are an abundant byproduct of the food-processing industry, that provides large quantities of this biopolymer to be used in biomedical applications.Chitin is not a protein, but is similar to protein in that they are both polymers. Protein is made up of amino acids, while chitin is made up of amino sugars. So chitin wouldnt be considered a source of protein. Still though, chitin acts somewhat similar to certain proteins.The monomers in a chitin molecule are a beta-glucose derivative with a different functional group at carbon 2. The beta linkages between monomers mean that chitin is structurally similar to cellulose.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). These units form covalent -(1→4)-linkages (like the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Chitin is made up of modified glucose monosaccharides. Glucose exists as a ring of carbon and oxygen molecules. Bonds between glucose molecules are known as glycosidic bonds. The oxygens that typically form hydroxyl groups bonded to the carbon ring can also form a bond with another carbon instead of a hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The main natural sources of chitin are shrimp and crab shells, which are an abundant byproduct of the food-processing industry, that provides large quantities of this biopolymer to be used in biomedical applications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Chitin is not a protein, but is similar to protein in that they are both polymers. Protein is made up of amino acids, while chitin is made up of amino sugars. So chitin wouldn’t be considered a source of protein. Still though, chitin acts somewhat similar to certain proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The monomers in a chitin molecule are a beta-glucose derivative with a different functional group at carbon 2. The beta linkages between monomers mean that chitin is structurally similar to cellulose.
