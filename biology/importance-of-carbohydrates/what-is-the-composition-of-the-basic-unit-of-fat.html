<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A fat molecule consists of two kinds of parts: a glycerol backbone and three fatty acid tails. Glycerol is a small organic molecule with three hydroxyl (OH) groups, while a fatty acid consists of a long hydrocarbon chain attached to a carboxyl group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Triacylglycerol (Triglyceride) Triacylglycerol is the major form of dietary lipid in fats and oils, whether derived from plants or animals. Triacylglycerol is composed of three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol molecule (Figure 4).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A triglyceride is formed when the three hydroxyls (OH-) groups of a single glycerol molecule react with the carboxyl group (COOH-) of three fatty acids by forming ester bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Triglycerides are simple lipid which constituted one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. Triglyceride is the storage form of lipid, which is used for energy production.
