Adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy carrier in living things.

There are three main steps of cellular respiration: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.Glycolysis. Glycolysis (which is also known as the glycolytic pathway or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) is a sequence of 10 chemical reactions taking place in most cells that breaks down a glucose molecule into two pyruvate (pyruvic acid) molecules.The glucose is broken down first through the anaerobic process of glycolysis, leading to the production of some ATP and pyruvate end-product. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts to lactate through reduction.Once glucose is digested and transported to your cells, a process called cellular respiration releases the stored energy and converts it to energy that your cells can use.
