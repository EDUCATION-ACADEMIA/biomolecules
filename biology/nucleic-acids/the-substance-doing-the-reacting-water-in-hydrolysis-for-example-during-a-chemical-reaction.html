</title>
<meta name="description" content="In a hydrolysis reaction, a larger molecule forms two (or more) smaller molecules and water is consumed as a reactant. Hydrolysis (hydro = water and lysis = break) involves adding water to one large molecule to break it into multiple smaller molecules.Some examples of hydrolysis include dissolving a salt of a weak acid or base in water or dissolving sulphuric acid in water where hydronium and bisulfate compounds are formed. Hydrolysis also helps in breaking down proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates in food.Hydrolysis Reactions A hydrolysis reaction includes a water molecule as a reactant(Figure 3). During these reactions, a polymer can be broken into two components: one product carries a hydrogen ion (H+) from the water while the second product carries the waters remaining hydroxide (OH–).The reacting water molecules are split into hydrogen (H+) and hydroxide (OH−) ions, which react with and break up (or lyse) the other reacting compound. The term hydrolysis is also applied to the electrolysis of water (that is, breaking up of water molecules by an electric current) to produce hydrogen and oxygen.Hydrolysis involves the reaction of an organic chemical with water to form two or more new substances and usually means the cleavage of chemical bonds by the addition of water.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In a hydrolysis reaction, a larger molecule forms two (or more) smaller molecules and water is consumed as a reactant. Hydrolysis ("hydro” = water and “lysis” = break) involves adding water to one large molecule to break it into multiple smaller molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Some examples of hydrolysis include dissolving a salt of a weak acid or base in water or dissolving sulphuric acid in water where hydronium and bisulfate compounds are formed. Hydrolysis also helps in breaking down proteins, fats, and complex carbohydrates in food.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrolysis Reactions A hydrolysis reaction includes a water molecule as a reactant(Figure 3). During these reactions, a polymer can be broken into two components: one product carries a hydrogen ion (H+) from the water while the second product carries the water’s remaining hydroxide (OH–).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The reacting water molecules are split into hydrogen (H+) and hydroxide (OH−) ions, which react with and break up (or “lyse") the other reacting compound. The term hydrolysis is also applied to the electrolysis of water (that is, breaking up of water molecules by an electric current) to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hydrolysis involves the reaction of an organic chemical with water to form two or more new substances and usually means the cleavage of chemical bonds by the addition of water.
