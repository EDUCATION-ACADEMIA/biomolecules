<meta name="description" content="RNA does not have double stranded α-helix structure. Helixes present in RNA are single-stranded but sometimes they fold back on themselves to form a double helix structure. RNA has the ability to replicate.Unlike DNA, however, RNA is most often single-stranded. An RNA molecule has a backbone made of alternating phosphate groups and the sugar ribose, rather than the deoxyribose found in DNA.
