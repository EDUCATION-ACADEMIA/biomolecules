<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During every cell division, a cell must duplicate its chromosomal DNA through a process called DNA replication. The duplicated DNA is then segregated into two “daughter” cells that inherit the same genetic information.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The DNA polymerase binds to single-stranded DNA after the Helicase has unwound the DNA and begins the polymerization process. It makes two identical copies of a parental DNA molecule by adding complimentary nucleotides to a resultant DNA molecule.
