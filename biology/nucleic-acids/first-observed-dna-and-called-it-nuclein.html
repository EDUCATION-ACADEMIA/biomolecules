<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-But precisely 150 years ago, back in 1869, a 25-year-old Swiss biochemist discovered a new substance in cells, calling it nuclein. It is this substance that is now known as DNA. The biochemist is all but forgotten. His name was Friedrich Miescher, and if you have not heard of him, you are not alone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The First Piece of the Puzzle: Miescher Discovers DNA Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called “nuclein” inside the nuclei of human white blood cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It was extracted for the first time from nuclei. It was identified by Friedrich Miescher in the year 1869. Since it was extracted from nuclei, it was named nuclein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Miescher recognised that he had discovered a novel molecule. Since he had isolated it from the cells’ nuclei he named it nuclein, a name preserved in today’s designation deoxyribonucleic acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The molecule of life The molecule now known as DNA was first identified in the 1860s by a Swiss chemist called Johann Friedrich Miescher. Johann set out to research the key components of white blood cells?, part of our body’s immune system.
