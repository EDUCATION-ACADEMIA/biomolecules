<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With very few exceptions a chemical is classified as organic if it contains at least one carbon atom, regardless of its source. This is why organic chemistry is called “the chemistry of carbon.” Generally that carbon atom is bonded to at least one hydrogen atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Scientists generally define a molecule as organic when it contains not only carbon, but also at least one other element. Typically, that element is hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Some definitions say that a molecule must contain both carbon and hydrogen to be organic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Significance of Carbon. A compound found mainly in living things is known as an organic compound. Organic compounds make up the cells and other structures of organisms and carry out life processes. Carbon is the main element in organic compounds, so carbon is essential to life on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Organic compounds are defined as covalently bonded compounds containing carbon, excluding carbonates and oxides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-a(1) : of, relating to, or derived from living organisms. (2) : relating to, yielding, dealing in, or involving the use of food produced with the use of feed or fertilizer of plant or animal origin without employment of chemically formulated fertilizers, growth stimulants, antibiotics, or pesticides. organic stores.
