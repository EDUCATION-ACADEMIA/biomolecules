<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure is largely credited to the scientists Watson and Crick, for which they won a Nobel Prize. However, the X-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin and Erwin Chargaff’s work in discovering the composition of DNA were instrumental to the discovery of DNA’s structure.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Chargaff’s first parity rule, as this is now called, was an important clue that James Watson and Francis Crick used to develop their base pair model for the double helix structure. Biologists now know that since A binds with T and G binds with C to form a double helix, this rule holds for all double stranded DNA.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Chargaff’s realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick’s derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The double helix is a description of the molecular shape of a double-stranded DNA molecule. In 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson first described the molecular structure of DNA, which they called a “double helix, ” in the journal Nature.
