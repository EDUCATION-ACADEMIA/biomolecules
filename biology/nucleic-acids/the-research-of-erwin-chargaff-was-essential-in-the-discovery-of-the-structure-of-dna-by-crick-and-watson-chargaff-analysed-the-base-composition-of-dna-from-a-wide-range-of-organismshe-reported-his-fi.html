<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure is largely credited to the scientists Watson and Crick, for which they won a Nobel Prize. However, the X-ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin and Erwin Chargaff’s work in discovering the composition of DNA were instrumental to the discovery of DNA’s structure.

Biologists now know that since A binds with T and G binds with C to form a double helix, this rule holds for all double stranded DNA.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Chargaff’s realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick’s derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.
