<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Without enzymes, the chemical reactions in the body would occur too slowly to support life processes. This is because enzymes are biocatalysts that increase the rate of the biochemical reactions by providing an alternative reaction pathway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins – primary constituents of all living organisms. They act as catalysts, which means that they make biochemical reactions happen faster than they would otherwise. Without enzymes, those reactions simply would not occur or would run too slowly to sustain life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In the absence of enzymatic catalysis, most biochemical reactions are so slow that they would not occur under the mild conditions of temperature and pressure that are compatible with life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All biological reactions within human cells depend on enzymes. Their power as catalysts enables biological reactions to occur usually in milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes in our bodies are catalysts that speed up reactions by helping to lower the activation energy needed to start a reaction. Each enzyme molecule has a special place called the active site where another molecule, called the substrate, fits.
