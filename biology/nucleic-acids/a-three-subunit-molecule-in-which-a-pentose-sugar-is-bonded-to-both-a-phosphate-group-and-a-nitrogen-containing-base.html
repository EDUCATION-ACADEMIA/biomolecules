<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Nucleotides are composed of three subunit molecules: a nucleobase, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a phosphate group consisting of one to three phosphates. The four nucleobases in DNA are guanine, adenine, cytosine and thymine; in RNA, uracil is used in place of thymine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Nucleotide(s) A three-subunit molecule in which a pentose sugar is bonded to both a phosphate group and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic base. Polysome(s) A complex of mRNA and several ribosomes. Primary nucleic acid structure The order in which the nucleotides are linked together in the nucleic acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Therefore, the bond between sugar and phosphate is phosphoester bond which is a covalent bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-2’-Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) It is a large polymeric molecule composed of monomers known as nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a heterocyclic base, a pentose sugar (2’-deoxy-d-ribofuranose), and a phosphate group. There are four heterocyclic bases in DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T).
