<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Like all other catalysts, enzymes are characterized by two fundamental properties. First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The enzyme-substrate complex can also lower activation energy by bending substrate molecules in a way that facilitates bond-breaking, helping to reach the transition state. Finally, some enzymes lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction themselves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes allow activation energies to be lowered. Enzymes lower the activation energy necessary to transform a reactant into a product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice; mixing, surface area, and temperature are important factors in reaction rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some reactions require a great amount of activation energy, which acts as an energy barrier making it difficult for the reactants to come together and react. Enzymes reduce the energy needed for the reactants to come together, increasing the rate of the chemical reaction.
