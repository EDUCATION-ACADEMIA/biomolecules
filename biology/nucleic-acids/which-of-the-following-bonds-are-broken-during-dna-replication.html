<title>Which of the following bonds are broken during DNA replication?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="In general, DNA is replicated by uncoiling of the helix, strand separation by breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, and synthesis of two new strands by complementary base pairing.The initiation of DNA replication occurs in two steps. First, a so-called initiator protein unwinds a short stretch of the DNA double helix. Then, a protein known as helicase attaches to and breaks apart the hydrogen bonds between the bases on the DNA strands, thereby pulling apart the two strands.The hydrogen bonds are broken in the double stranded DNA, creating single strands of DNA that are susceptible to copying. The primers (custom-made, short DNA strands, specifically designed to bond to sites at the beginning and end of the segment to be copied) bind to the DNA.Explanation: Helicases are enzymes involved in the unzipping of the double-stranded DNA molecule at beginning of DNA replication. They do so by binding at DNA sequences called origins on DNA molecule then they break the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs causing the two strands of DNA molecule to unzip.Hydrogen bonds occur between the two strands and involve a base from one strand with a base from the second in complementary pairing.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In general, DNA is replicated by uncoiling of the helix, strand separation by breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, and synthesis of two new strands by complementary base pairing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The initiation of DNA replication occurs in two steps. First, a so-called initiator protein unwinds a short stretch of the DNA double helix. Then, a protein known as helicase attaches to and breaks apart the hydrogen bonds between the bases on the DNA strands, thereby pulling apart the two strands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The hydrogen bonds are broken in the double stranded DNA, creating single strands of DNA that are susceptible to copying. The primers (custom-made, short DNA strands, specifically designed to bond to sites at the beginning and end of the segment to be copied) bind to the DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Explanation: Helicases are enzymes involved in the unzipping of the double-stranded DNA molecule at beginning of DNA replication. They do so by binding at DNA sequences called origins on DNA molecule then they break the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs causing the two strands of DNA molecule to unzip.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonds occur between the two strands and involve a base from one strand with a base from the second in complementary pairing. These hydrogen bonds are individually weak but collectively quite strong.
