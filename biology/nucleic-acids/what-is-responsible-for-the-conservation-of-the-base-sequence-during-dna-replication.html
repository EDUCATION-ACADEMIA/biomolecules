<strong> What is responsible for the conservation of the base sequence during DNA replication? 
</strong>
<p>(A) DNA polymerase working on one strand at the same time. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Unpaired bases always attracting their complementary nucleotides. 
</p>
<p>(C) DNA helicase and polymerase are complementary. 
</p>
<p>(D) Both strands are identical to each other. 
</p>

<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Unpaired bases always attracting their complementary nucleotides. The process of DNA replication within the cells of living organisms begin with the helix being unwound so the two strands are separated. Helicase is responsible for this, separating the strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the bases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The new strands formed are complementary to their template strands but also identical to the other template. Therefore, complementary base pairing has a big role in the conservation of the base sequence of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is responsible for the conservation of the base sequence during DNA replication? DNA polymerase working on one strand at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a round of replication, each of the two strands of DNA is used as a template for the formation of a complementary DNA strand. The original strands therefore remain intact through many cell generations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Function. Complementary base pairing is important in DNA as it allows the base pairs to be arranged in the most energetically favourable way; it is essential in forming the helical structure of DNA. It is also important in replication as it allows semiconservative replication.
