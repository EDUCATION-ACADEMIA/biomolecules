<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The result of DNA replication is two DNA molecules consisting of one new and one old chain of nucleotides. This is why DNA replication is described as semi-conservative, half of the chain is part of the original DNA molecule, half is brand new.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as semiconservative replication. When two DNA copies are formed, they have an identical sequence of nucleotide bases and are divided equally into two daughter cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each DNA molecule resulting from replication has one original strand and one new strand. DNA replication is carried out by a series of enzymes. Helicase is the enzyme that “unzips” a molecule of DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between base pairs and unwinding the two strands of the molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-During DNA replication, one new strand (the leading strand) is made as a continuous piece. The other (the lagging strand) is made in small pieces. DNA replication requires other enzymes in addition to DNA polymerase, including DNA primase, DNA helicase, DNA ligase, and topoisomerase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In both cases, replication occurs so quickly because multiple polymerases can synthesize two new strands at the same time by using each unwound strand from the original DNA double helix as a template. One of these original strands is called the leading strand, whereas the other is called the lagging strand.
