<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Change in “primary structure” (linear amino acid chain) will cause change in all other higher “protein structural levels” (secondary, tertiary, and quaternarystructure) and thus, change protein function as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The unique amino acid sequence of a protein is reflected in its unique folded structure. This structure, in turn, determines the protein’s function. This is why mutations that alter amino acid sequence can affect the function of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The four levels of protein structure are primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The tertiary structure is functional as it has the non-covalent and covalent bonds along with the subunits attached at the right places, which help it function properly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Each protein has its own unique shape. If the temperature or pH of a protein’s environment is changed, or if it is exposed to chemicals, these interactions may be disrupted, causing the protein to lose its three-dimensional structure and turn back into an unstructured string of amino acids.
