<title>A piece of DNA was analysed and 15% of its nucleotides were adenine. What percentage would be uracil?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="A: The correct answer is option 2 The segment with 24%C content.Answer and Explanation: If a DNA sample were composed of 15% adenine then there would also be 15% thymine according to Chargaffs rules. Chargaffs rules explained that adenine always pairs with thymine and cytosine always pairs with guanine in a DNA molecule.If 15% of the nucleotides in a DNA molecule contain guanine, what percentage of the nucleotides contain each of the other three bases? Explain your reasoning. Total will be 100%. So if 15% is Guanine then Cytosine has to be 15% (because they base pair with each other).Correct answer: Together, adenine and thymine compose 70% of the segment. This means that 30% of the section is composed of guanine-cytosine pairs. Since these two bases will be equal in quantity, 15% of the DNA section will be cytosine bases.So since they have asked only regarding the uracil, We can say that it is only 15%.">

<strong> A piece of DNA was analysed and 15% of its nucleotides were adenine. What percentage would be uracil? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** 0

<p>(B) 15% 
</p>
<p>(C) 30% 
</p>
<p>(D) 35%

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A: The correct answer is option 2 The segment with 24%C content.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: If a DNA sample were composed of 15% adenine then there would also be 15% thymine according to Chargaff’s rules. Chargaff’s rules explained that adenine always pairs with thymine and cytosine always pairs with guanine in a DNA molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If 15% of the nucleotides in a DNA molecule contain guanine, what percentage of the nucleotides contain each of the other three bases? Explain your reasoning. Total will be 100%. So if 15% is Guanine then Cytosine has to be 15% (because they base pair with each other).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Correct answer: Together, adenine and thymine compose 70% of the segment. This means that 30% of the section is composed of guanine-cytosine pairs. Since these two bases will be equal in quantity, 15% of the DNA section will be cytosine bases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-So since they have asked only regarding the uracil, We can say that it is only 15%.
