<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This substance was found to exist only in the chromosomes. Frederick Griffith, a scientist, was working on a project in 1928 that formed the basis that DNA was the molecule of inheritance. the cell nucleus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Who first identified DNA? Although James Watson and Francis Crick determined the double-helical structure of DNA, DNA itself was identified nearly 90 years earlier by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Transformation in Bacteria In 1928, in an attempt to develop a vaccine against pneumonia, Frederick Griffith became the first to identify bacterial transformation, in which the form and function of a bacterium changes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In 1928, in what is today known as Griffith’s experiment, he discovered what he called a “transforming principle” that caused inheritance. Oswald and his colleagues, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty continued Griffith’s research and discovered in 1944 that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty showed that DNA (not proteins) can transform the properties of cells, clarifying the chemical nature of genes. Avery, MacLeod and McCarty identified DNA as the “transforming principle” while studying Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteria that can cause pneumonia.
