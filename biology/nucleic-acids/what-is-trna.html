<strong> What is tRNA? 
</strong>
<p>(A) This type of RNA contains codon and matches up with anti-codons 
</p>
<p>(B) ** This type of RNA carries amino acids to the ribosome, contains an anti-codon, the first letter stands for transfer and it is in the shape of a lowercase t

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA) is a small RNA molecule that plays a key role in protein synthesis. Transfer RNA serves as a link (or adaptor) between the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule and the growing chain of amino acids that make up a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A transfer RNA (tRNA) is a special kind of RNA molecule. Its job is to match an mRNA codon with the amino acid it codes for. You can think of it as a kind of molecular “bridge” between the two. Each tRNA contains a set of three nucleotides called an anticodon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During translation, these tRNAs carry amino acids to the ribosome and join with their complementary codons. Then, the assembled amino acids are joined together as the ribosome, with its resident rRNAs, moves along the mRNA molecule in a ratchet-like motion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-transfer RNA / tRNA Transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) is a type of RNA molecule that helps decode a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a protein. tRNAs function at specific sites in the ribosome during translation, which is a process that synthesizes a protein from an mRNA molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Transfer RNA (tRNA) does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthesizing machinery of a cell called the ribosome.
