</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are 4 major biological macromolecules: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Monomers are the building blocks of the four basic macromolecules of life-monosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates, amino acids are the monomers of proteins, glycerol/fatty acids are the monomers of lipids, and nucleotides are the monomers of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-From the smallest single-celled organism to the tallest tree, all life depends on the properties and reactions of four classes of organic (carbon-based) compounds-carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
