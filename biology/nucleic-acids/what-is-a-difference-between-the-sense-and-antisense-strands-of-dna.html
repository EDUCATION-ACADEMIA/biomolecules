<strong> What is a difference between the sense and antisense strands of DNA?

<p>(B) The sense strand has the same base sequence as tRNA, but the antisense strand does not. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Nucleotides are linked to the antisense strand by hydrogen bonding during transcription, but not to the sense strand. 
</p>
<p>(D) The antisense strand has the same base sequence as mRNA but the sense strand does not.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-the sense strand has the same base sequences as tRNA, but the antisense strand does not c. nucleotides are linked to the antisense strand by hydrogen bonding during transcription, but the sense strand does not d. the antisense strand has the same base sequence as mRNA but the sense strand does not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-One strand of DNA is called the sense strand because when you read it in the right direction it provides the code to make a protein. In two-stranded DNA, the sense strand is bonded to an opposite DNA strand that is called the antisense or noncoding strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During the transcription, one DNA strand actively participates as a template, which is called antisense strand or template strand. The other complementary strand is called sense strand or coding strand. The key difference is that unlike antisense strand, the sense strand is not used in the transcription process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What is a difference between the sense and antisense strands of DNA? Nucleotides are linked to the sense strand by hydrogen bonding during transcription, but not to the antisense strand. The sense strand has the same base sequence as tRNA, but the antisense strand does not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A DNA segment encoding a protein usually has a “sense” strand and a complementary “antisense” strand which acts as a template for RNA polymerase. Conventionally, the sense strand is considered to encode the protein since it has the same sequence as the mRNA.
