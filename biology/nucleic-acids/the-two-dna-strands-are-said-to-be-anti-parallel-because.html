<title>The two DNA strands are said to be anti-parallel because?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="In biochemistry, two biopolymers are antiparallel if they run parallel to each other but with opposite directionality (alignments). An example is the two complementary strands of a DNA double helix, which run in opposite directions alongside each other.DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonding. The strands each run from 5 to 3 and run in antiparallel, or opposite, directions from one another.Each end of DNA molecule has a number. One end is referred to as 5 (five prime) and the other end is referred to as 3 (three prime). The 5 and 3 designations refer to the number of carbon atom in a deoxyribose sugar molecule to which a phosphate group bonds.If the DNA strand was parallel, replication would not be possible. The nucleotides would not be complementary to each other and, as a result, would not pair in a genetic molecule. Therefore, the DNA being antiparallel is the only way replication and life could occur.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In biochemistry, two biopolymers are antiparallel if they run parallel to each other but with opposite directionality (alignments). An example is the two complementary strands of a DNA double helix, which run in opposite directions alongside each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonding. The strands each run from 5’ to 3’ and run in antiparallel, or opposite, directions from one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each end of DNA molecule has a number. One end is referred to as 5’ (five prime) and the other end is referred to as 3’ (three prime). The 5’ and 3’ designations refer to the number of carbon atom in a deoxyribose sugar molecule to which a phosphate group bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If the DNA strand was parallel, replication would not be possible. The nucleotides would not be complementary to each other and, as a result, would not pair in a genetic molecule. Therefore, the DNA being antiparallel is the only way replication and life could occur.
