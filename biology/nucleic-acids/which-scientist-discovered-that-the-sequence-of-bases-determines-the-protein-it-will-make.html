<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Har Gobind Khorana made important contributions to this field by building different RNA chains with the help of enzymes. Using these enzymes, he was able to produce proteins. The amino acid sequences of these proteins then solved the rest of the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Khorana was the first scientist to chemically synthesize oligonucleotides. This achievement, in the 1970s, was also the worldâ€™s first synthetic gene; in later years, the process has become widespread. Subsequent scientists referred to his research while advancing genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
