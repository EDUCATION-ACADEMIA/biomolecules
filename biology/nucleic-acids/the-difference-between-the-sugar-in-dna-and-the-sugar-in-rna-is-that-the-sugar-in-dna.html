<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-There are three differences between the structures of DNA and RNA: The sugars in the backbone of DNA and RNA differ by one oxygen atom. The deoxy-prefix in DNA indicates that the sugar is like ribose, but with one less oxygen atom. DNA is double stranded but RNA contains only a single strand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are two differences that distinguish DNA from RNA: (a) RNA contains the sugar ribose, while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen atom), and (b) RNA has the nucleobase uracil while DNA contains thymine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The really important difference is that RNA has an extra oxygen atom. This makes RNA less stable than DNA. You might think that being unstable is a bad thing, but there are advantages. Organisms that need to change rapidly tend to use RNA as their genetic material.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ribose is made of five carbon atoms, ten hydrogen atoms and five oxygen atoms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-DNA is a double-stranded molecule that has a long chain of nucleotides. RNA is a single-stranded molecule which has a shorter chain of nucleotides. DNA replicates on its own, it is self-replicating. RNA does not replicate on its own.
