<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-DNA consists of two strands that wind around each other like a twisted ladder. Each strand has a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases–adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Phosphodiesters in DNA and RNA The phosphodiester backbone of DNA and RNA consists of pairs of deoxyribose or ribose sugars linked by phosphates at the respective 3’ and 5’ positions. The backbone is negatively charged and hydrophilic, which allows strong interactions with water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Surprisingly though there are only a few different nucleotides: only four different nucleotide units comprise DNA, the nucleic acid of interest to the genealogist. Alternating sugar and phosphate units form the two sides of a ladder-shaped arrangement with the rungs or steps each formed by a pair of nucleotide bases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The sugars and phosphates are referred to as the “backbone” because they provide the structure and support of the molecule, keeping these bases in the correct order. How can an enormous amount of DNA fit inside one cell? The chromosomes that are found in prokaryotes are different from those found in eukaryotes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The sides of DNA are made up of deoxyribose sugar molecules and phosphate molecules.
