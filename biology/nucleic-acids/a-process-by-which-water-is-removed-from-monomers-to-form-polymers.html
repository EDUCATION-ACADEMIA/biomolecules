<title>A process by which water is removed from monomers to form polymers.
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means to put together while losing water. Figure 3.1.Dehydration synthesis is the reaction at which two small molecules react together to form a new large molecule by removing a water molecule or water molecules.Dehydration synthesis involves the formation of new chemical bonds between two molecules which leads to the formation of new compounds. A reaction occurs with the loss of water molecules at each step. The loss of water molecules can occur due to reactions between two functional groups like –OH, -NH2 or –COOH.The additional monomers join via dehydration synthesis reactions and now this chain of repeating monomers forms new polymers. In the dehydration method of polymer formation, the hydrogen of one polymer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer and thereby releasing a molecule of water.You can remember what happens by the name of the reaction: dehydration, for the loss of the water molecule, and synthesis, for the formation of a new bond. Dehydration synthesis reaction between two molecules of glucose, forming a molecule of maltose with the release of a water molecule.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.” Figure 3.1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis is the reaction at which two small molecules react together to form a new large molecule by removing a water molecule or water molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis involves the formation of new chemical bonds between two molecules which leads to the formation of new compounds. A reaction occurs with the loss of water molecules at each step. The loss of water molecules can occur due to reactions between two functional groups like –OH, -NH2 or –COOH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The additional monomers join via dehydration synthesis reactions and now this chain of repeating monomers forms new polymers. In the dehydration method of polymer formation, the hydrogen of one polymer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer and thereby releasing a molecule of water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-You can remember what happens by the name of the reaction: dehydration, for the loss of the water molecule, and synthesis, for the formation of a new bond. Dehydration synthesis reaction between two molecules of glucose, forming a molecule of maltose with the release of a water molecule.
