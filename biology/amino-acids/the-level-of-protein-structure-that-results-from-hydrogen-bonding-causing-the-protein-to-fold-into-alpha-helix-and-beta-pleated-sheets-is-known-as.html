<meta name="description" content="The most common types of secondary structures are the α helix and the β pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.The sequence of amino acids in a protein is called its primary structure. The secondary structure is determined by the dihedral angles of the peptide bonds, the tertiary structure by the folding of protein chains in space.Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain sometimes causes certain patterns of folding to occur. Known as alpha helices and beta sheets, these stable folding patterns make up the secondary structure of a protein.The answer is (c) Tertiary and quaternary. Interactions like hydrogen bonding among amino side chains stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins.An α-helix secondary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl oxygen and the amino group of every third residue in the helical turn with each helical turn consisting of 3.6 amino acid residues (Fig. 10.1A).

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The sequence of amino acids in a protein is called its primary structure. The secondary structure is determined by the dihedral angles of the peptide bonds, the tertiary structure by the folding of protein chains in space.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain sometimes causes certain patterns of folding to occur. Known as alpha helices and beta sheets, these stable folding patterns make up the secondary structure of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The answer is (c) Tertiary and quaternary. Interactions like hydrogen bonding among amino side chains stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An -helix secondary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl oxygen and the amino group of every third residue in the helical turn with each helical turn consisting of 3.6 amino acid residues (Fig. 10.1A). The side chain of amino acids is projected outward from the outer helical surface.
