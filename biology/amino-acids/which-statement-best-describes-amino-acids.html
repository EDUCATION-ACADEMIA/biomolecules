<title>Which statement best describes amino acids?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Amino acids can act as both an acid and a base due to the presence of the amino and carboxyl functional groups. The pH at which a given amino acid exists in solution as a zwitterion is called the isoelectric point (pI).Expert-Verified Answer. The answer to this question is organic. When it comes to amino acids, they are the building blocks of protein. The organic compounds contain carboxyl and amine functional groups along with the side chain.An amino acid has both a basic amine group and an acidic carboxylic acid group. There is an internal transfer of a hydrogen ion from the-COOH group to the-NH2 group to leave an ion with both a negative charge and a positive charge. This is called a zwitterion.The basic amino group typically has a pKa between 9 and 10, while the acidic Î±-carboxyl group has a pKa that is usually close to 2 (a very low value for carboxyls). The pKa of a group is the pH value at which the concentration of the protonated group equals that of the unprotonated group.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amino acids can act as both an acid and a base due to the presence of the amino and carboxyl functional groups. The pH at which a given amino acid exists in solution as a zwitterion is called the isoelectric point (pI).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Expert-Verified Answer. The answer to this question is organic. When it comes to amino acids, they are the building blocks of protein. The organic compounds contain carboxyl and amine functional groups along with the side chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An amino acid has both a basic amine group and an acidic carboxylic acid group. There is an internal transfer of a hydrogen ion from the-COOH group to the-NH2 group to leave an ion with both a negative charge and a positive charge. This is called a zwitterion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The basic amino group typically has a pKa between 9 and 10, while the acidic -carboxyl group has a pKa that is usually close to 2 (a very low value for carboxyls). The pKa of a group is the pH value at which the concentration of the protonated group equals that of the unprotonated group.
