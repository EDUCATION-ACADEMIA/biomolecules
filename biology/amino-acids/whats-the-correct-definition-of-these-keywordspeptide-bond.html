<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A peptide bond also sometimes called eupeptide bond is a chemical bond that is formed by joining the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. A peptide bond is basically an amide-type of covalent chemical bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Peptide bond: A covalent bond joining the -amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of another with the loss of a water molecule. From: Storing Digital Binary Data in Cellular DNA, 2020.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct statement about “ peptide bonds” is that they are A) covalent bonds between nitrogen and a carbon. A peptide bond is accountable for establishing a connection between two amino acids in the translation process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The amino acid acids are joined together by peptide bond to form short polymer chain called Peptide or long polymer chain called Protein. The peptide bond is formed between the amino group of one amino acid with carboxylic acid group of another amino group by eliminating water molecules.
