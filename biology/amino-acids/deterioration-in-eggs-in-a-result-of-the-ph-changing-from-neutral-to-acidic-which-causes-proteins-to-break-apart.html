<title>Deterioration in eggs in a result of the ph changing from neutral to acidic, which causes proteins to break apart
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Deterioration is eggs is a result of the pH changing from neutral to acidic, which causes proteins to break apart. To Help prevent curdling when acid and milk are combined, first mix the acid with water to reduce the pH. Curdled baked custard is an example of emulsified protein.Denaturation (changing the nature) happens when protein molecules unravel from their naturally coiled state. With eggs, this happens most frequently when theyre heated or beaten, but denaturation can also be prompted by salt, acids (such as vinegar), alkalies (such as baking soda), and freezing.A protein becomes denatured when its normal shape gets deformed because some of the hydrogen bonds are broken.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deterioration is eggs is a result of the pH changing from neutral to acidic, which causes proteins to break apart. To Help prevent curdling when acid and milk are combined, first mix the acid with water to reduce the pH. Curdled baked custard is an example of emulsified protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Denaturation ("changing the nature") happens when protein molecules unravel from their naturally coiled state. With eggs, this happens most frequently when theyâ€™re heated or beaten, but denaturation can also be prompted by salt, acids (such as vinegar), alkalies (such as baking soda), and freezing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A protein becomes denatured when its normal shape gets deformed because some of the hydrogen bonds are broken. Weak hydrogen bonds break when too much heat is applied or when they are exposed to an acid (like citric acid from lemon juice).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Denaturation can also be caused by changes in the pH which can affect the chemistry of the amino acids and their residues. The ionizable groups in amino acids are able to become ionized when changes in pH occur. A pH change to more acidic or more basic conditions can induce unfolding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Denaturation is what happens when heat is applied to the eggs. Chemically, this is the process by which the chains of amino acids are changed from their original (or native) state. The heat coming from your stove denatures the protein by disrupting some of its bonds that held the molecule into shape.
