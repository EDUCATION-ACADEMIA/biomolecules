<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A residue is a monomer that results when two or more amino acids combine and remove water molecules. The primary structure of a protein, a peptide chain, is made of amino acid residues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A peptide bond is a covalent bond, formed as 2 amino acids are joined together through dehydration synthesis, a process in which a water molecule is removed as a byproduct to link monomers together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A peptide bond is formed via the condensation of one amino acidâ€™s alpha-carboxy group with the alpha-amino group of another amino acid. Thus, the joining together of two amino acids results in the loss of one water molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When two amino acids combine in a condensation reaction, a covalent bond forms between the amine nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of the second amino acid. A molecule of water is then removed as a second product. Figure 25.18.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide. The amide bond is synthesized when the carboxyl group of one amino acid molecule reacts with the amino group of the other amino acid molecule, causing the release of a molecule of water (H2O), hence the process is a dehydration synthesis reaction.
