<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-option A must be the answer as Random coils are not part of the protein secondary structures and they have normal peptide sequence as in native protein, usually formed when denatured. The non polar or hydrophobic folding, alpha helices and beta pleated sheets stabilize the secondary structures of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-There are three common secondary structures in proteins, namely alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The complete structure of a protein can be described at four different levels of complexity: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.
