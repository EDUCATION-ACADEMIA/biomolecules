<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-On application of electrical field, they migrate towards anode or cathode based on their net charge. Electrophoresis is defined as the migration of electrically charged molecules under the effect of the electrical field. Tiselius used a liquid medium that had less resolution due to the effect of gravity and diffusion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Definition. 00:00. … Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate DNA, RNA or protein molecules based on their size and electrical charge. An electric current is used to move the molecules through a gel or other matrix.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The molecules’ movement is influenced by the porous gel matrix such that larger, heavier molecules move relatively slowly, whereas smaller, lighter molecules move more quickly. The density of pores and the type of substance used to make the gel further influence the rate of molecule migration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Electrophoresis is a general term that describes the migration and separation of charged particles (ions) under the influence of an electric field. An electrophoretic system consists of two electrodes of opposite charge (anode, cathode), connected by a conducting medium called an electrolyte.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Thus, electrophoresis is the movement of charged particles in stationary liquid under electrical field. With particles of different shape, the electrophoretic velocity can be expressed by Eq. (3.4) [117].
