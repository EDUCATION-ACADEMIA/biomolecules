<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A peptide bond is formed by a dehydration synthesis or reaction at a molecular level. This reaction is also known as a condensation reaction which usually occurs between amino acids. As depicted in the figure given below, two amino acids bond together to form a peptide bond by the dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Condensation polymerisation involves monomers with two functional groups When these types of monomers react they join together and usually lose small molecules, such as water. This is why they are called condensation reactions. Amino acids. Amino acids have two functional groups in a molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Translation: The process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain is called translation. During the translation process, the genetic information stored in mRNA directs the order of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Ribosomes along with tRNA also participate in the process of translation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Amino acids can be linked by a condensation reaction in which an ―OH is lost from the carboxyl group of one amino acid along with a hydrogen from the amino group of a second, forming a molecule of water and leaving the two amino acids linked via an amide-called, in this case, a peptide bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-All proteins contain the elements C, O, H, N. They are condensation polymers, made by amino acids linking together. An amine group of one molecule links to the carboxyl group of another molecule to form an amide or peptide bond.
