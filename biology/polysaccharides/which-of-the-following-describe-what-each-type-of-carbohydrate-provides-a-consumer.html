<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sugars and starches provide glucose, the main energy source for the brain, central nervous system, and RBCs. Glucose also can be stored as glycogen (animal starch) in liver and muscle or, like all excess calories in the body, converted to body fat. Dietary fibers are nondigestible forms of carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The two main types of carbohydrates are simple carbs and complex carbs. Simple carbs are found in everything from table sugar to fruit, while complex carbs, or starches, come from whole grains and vegetables like sweet potatoes. Both types of carbs give your body energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Monosaccharides are carbohydrate molecules that cannot be broken down by hydrolysis2 into simpler (smaller) carbohydrate molecules. Hence, monosaccharides are at times referred to as “simple sugars” or just :sugars, ” which infers that they are the simplest (smallest) of the carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Carbohydrates can be divided into two main types: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are made up of just one or two sugar units, whereas complex carbohydrates are made up of many sugar units. We’ll look at each of these in turn.
