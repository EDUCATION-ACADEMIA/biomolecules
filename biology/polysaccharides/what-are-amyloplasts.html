<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amyloplasts are specifically a type of leucoplast, a subcategory for colorless, non-pigment-containing plastids. Amyloplasts are found in roots and storage tissues, and they store and synthesize starch for the plant through the polymerization of glucose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Amyloplasts are plant-specific organelles responsible for starch biosynthesis and storage. Inside amyloplasts, starch forms insoluble particles, referred to as starch grains (SGs).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An amyloplast is a leucoplast. It doesnâ€™t have pigment or color. Leucoplasts are found in a variety of non-photosynthetic plant tissues and serve various functions, including, as in the case of an amyloplast, the storage of starch.
