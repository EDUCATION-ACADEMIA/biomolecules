<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With the binding of substrate, the active site activates the enzyme and the enzyme catalyzes the reaction. Hence, all the given statements are true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The correct answer is (b) Enzymes can require vitamin or mineral cofactors for their function. Enzymes are proteins that function to catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms. Some enzymes can function on their own, but others require vitamin or mineral cofactors in order to function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes change shape to fit their substrate.: TRUE: The active site can change shape to more tightly bind with the substrate and catalyze the reaction known as induced fit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following is true regarding the structure of enzymes? The active site is where the enzyme binds with the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is (b) An active site is normally hydrophilic in nature. The active site of an enzyme is the location, typically a hollow hole or cleft in the enzyme’s surface, where reactants bind and are converted to substrates.
