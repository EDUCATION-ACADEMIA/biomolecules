Proteins are made in different amounts and at different times, depending on how they work, when they are needed, and how they interact with other proteins inside cells.Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-(PROH-tee-ome) The complete set of proteins made by an organism. Proteins are made in different amounts and at different times, depending on how they work, when they are needed, and how they interact with other proteins inside cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism.
