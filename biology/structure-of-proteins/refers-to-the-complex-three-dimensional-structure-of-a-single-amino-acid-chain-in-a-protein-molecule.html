<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The tertiary structure of a protein refers to the overall three-dimensional arrangement of its polypeptide chain in space. It is generally stabilized by outside polar hydrophilic hydrogen and ionic bond interactions, and internal hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar amino acid side chains (Fig.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is called its tertiary structure. The tertiary structure is primarily due to interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Tertiary structure-the level of protein structure at which an entire polypeptide chain has folded into a three-dimensional structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Tertiary structure is the next level up from the secondary structure, and is the particular three-dimensional arrangement of all the amino acids in a single polypeptide chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The full three-dimensional organization of a polypeptide chain is sometimes referred to as the proteinâ€™s tertiary structure, and if a particular protein molecule is formed as a complex of more than one polypeptide chain, the complete structure is designated as the quaternary structure.
