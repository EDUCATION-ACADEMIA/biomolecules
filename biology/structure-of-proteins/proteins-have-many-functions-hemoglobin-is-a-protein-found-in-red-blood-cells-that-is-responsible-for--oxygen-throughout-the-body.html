<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein that is found within all RBCs. It picks up oxygen where it is abundant (the lungs) and drops off oxygen where it is needed around the body. Hemoglobin is also the pigment that gives RBCs their red color.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hemoglobin contains iron, which allows it to pick up oxygen from the air we breathe and deliver it everywhere in the body. You can think of hemoglobin as the iron ("heme"), oxygen transport protein, ("globin") found in red blood cells. Itâ€™s the hemoglobin that gives red blood cells their color, too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Bone marrow creates almost all of the cells in your body. Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Hemoglobin (Heme + Globin) The protein hemoglobin is a molecule which is responsible for carrying almost all of the oxygen in the blood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. It contains iron, which allows it to transport oxygen. Each hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules. This way, it can transport the oxygen from the lungs to the tissues that need it.
