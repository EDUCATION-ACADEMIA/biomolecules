<title>What is the relationship between DNA and proteins in all organisms?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Like words in a sentence, the DNA sequence of a gene determines the amino acid sequence for the protein it encodes. In the protein-coding region of a gene, the DNA sequence is interpreted in groups of three nucleotide bases, called codons. Each codon specifies a single amino acid in a protein.Answer and Explanation: The relationship between DNA and protein is that DNA has the code, or instructions, for making protein. DNA is the genetic material of the cell. It has all of the information needed for cell structure and function, which are carried out by proteins.The genetic materials in a cell, whether DNA or RNA, contain the instructions on how to assemble proteins from amino acids. The latter are organic compounds that have an amino functional group (−NH+3), a carboxylate (−CO−2) functional group, and a side chain, which uniquely identifies each type.The sequence of basis on the DNA molecule is what directs the sequence of amino acids in the protein molecule-thats how it all links together! So, the sequence of bases in DNA codes for the sequence of amino acids of a protein.">

<strong> What is the relationship between DNA and proteins in all organisms? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The nucleotide sequences contain the instructions used to synthesize amino acids 
</p>
<p>(B) The amino acid sequences contain the instructions used to synthesize DNA and RNA 
</p>
<p>(C) The helical shape of DNA resembles the helical shape of some proteins that are found in all cells 
</p>
<p>(D) Cells are the same in all organisms, therefore there is no significant relationship between DNA and amino acids 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Like words in a sentence, the DNA sequence of a gene determines the amino acid sequence for the protein it encodes. In the protein-coding region of a gene, the DNA sequence is interpreted in groups of three nucleotide bases, called codons. Each codon specifies a single amino acid in a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The relationship between DNA and protein is that DNA has the code, or instructions, for making protein. DNA is the genetic material of the cell. It has all of the information needed for cell structure and function, which are carried out by proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The genetic materials in a cell, whether DNA or RNA, contain the instructions on how to assemble proteins from amino acids. The latter are organic compounds that have an amino functional group (−NH+3), a carboxylate (−CO−2) functional group, and a side chain, which uniquely identifies each type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The sequence of basis on the DNA molecule is what directs the sequence of amino acids in the protein molecule-that’s how it all links together! So, the sequence of bases in DNA codes for the sequence of amino acids of a protein.
