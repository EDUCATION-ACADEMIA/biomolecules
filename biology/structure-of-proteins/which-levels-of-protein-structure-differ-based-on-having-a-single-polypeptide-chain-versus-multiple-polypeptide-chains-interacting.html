<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The ensemble of formations and folds in a single linear chain of amino acids-sometimes called a polypeptide-constitutes the tertiary structure of a protein. Finally, the quaternary structure of a protein refers to those macromolecules with multiple polypeptide chains or subunits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-2 Tertiary and Quaternary Structures. Tertiary structure refers to the configuration of a protein subunit in three-dimensional space, while quaternary structure refers to the relationships of the four subunits of hemoglobin to each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Quaternary structure However, some proteins are made up of multiple polypeptide chains, also known as subunits. When these subunits come together, they give the protein its quaternary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Quaternary structure exists in proteins consisting of two or more identical or different polypeptide chains (subunits). These proteins are called oligomers because they have two or more subunits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Quaternary structure refers only to proteins that are composed of multiple polypeptides. These separate polypeptides are held together by the same intermolecular forces found in secondary and tertiary structures.
