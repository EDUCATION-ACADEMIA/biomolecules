<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Immunoglobulins or antibodies are essential in protecting against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When there is a deficiency of these glycoproteins, recurrent infectious diseases occur, as seen in the following antibody deficiency disorders[16]: X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Immunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. They can be separated functionally into variable (V) domains that binds antigens and constant (C) domains that specify effector functions such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-IgM immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells as part of the bodyâ€™s adaptive humoral immune response against a foreign pathogen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are glycoprotein molecules produced by plasma cells (white blood cells). They act as a critical part of the immune response by specifically recognizing and binding to particular antigens, such as bacteria or viruses, and aiding in their destruction.
