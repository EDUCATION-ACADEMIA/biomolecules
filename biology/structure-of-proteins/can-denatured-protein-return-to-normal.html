<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Due to changes in temperature, pH, or other chemical activities, denaturation of protein molecules occur. In many situations, denaturation is reversible. Proteins can not regain their native structure until the denaturing agent is removed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In many cases, denaturation is reversible. Since the primary structure of protein is intact, once the denaturing influence is removed, proteins can regain their native state by folding back to the original conformation. This process is called renaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In many cases, denaturation is reversible (the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed). This process can be called renaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzyme denaturation is the process in which the conformational change of protein structure occurs in response to a denaturing agent. The result is the active siteâ€™s conformation is altered and the activity of the enzyme is lost. No, a denatured enzyme cannot be renatured.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Protein denaturation is said to be irreversible when the denatured state achieved by increasing temperature or by using chemical denaturants is unable to return to the native, biologically functional state upon removal of the factor that caused denaturation.
