<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain sometimes causes certain patterns of folding to occur. Known as alpha helices and beta sheets, these stable folding patterns make up the secondary structure of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Secondary structure of the proteins can be used to predict the tertiary structure since predicting only with amino acid sequence may not be sufficient. The secondary structure of proteins is determined by the pattern of hydrogen bonding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The secondary structure is determined by the dihedral angles of the peptide bonds, the tertiary structure by the folding of protein chains in space. Association of folded polypeptide molecules to complex functional proteins results in quaternary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The secondary structure arises from the hydrogen bonds formed between atoms of the polypeptide backbone. The hydrogen bonds form between the partially negative oxygen atom and the partially positive nitrogen atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Secondary structure is generated by formation of hydrogen bonds between atoms in the polypeptide backbone, which folds the chains into either alpha helices or beta-sheets. Tertiary structure is formed by the folding of the secondary structure sheets or helices into one another.
