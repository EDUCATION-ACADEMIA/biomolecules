<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In biochemistry, globular proteins or spheroproteins are spherical ("globe-like") proteins and are one of the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane proteins). Globular proteins are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Globular proteins, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media. In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical. Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Globular proteins are round structures. Like their name, globular proteins have a round, spherical formation. This is because the hydrophobic parts of the protein fold inwards while the hydrophilic parts become arranged around the external surface. Globular proteins are water soluble.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What are 3 examples of globular proteins? Examples of globular proteins include albumin (a transport protein present in the blood), haemoglobin (an oxygen-carrying protein present in red blood cells), and antibodies (that participate in immune response).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Globular proteins form a spherical shape when folding into their tertiary structure because: their non-polar hydrophobic R groups are orientated towards the centre of the protein away from the aqueous surroundings and. their polar hydrophilic R groups orientate themselves on the outside of the protein.
