<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-While these foldings are held in place by certain bonds, the bonds that form between the polypeptides are, that is the bond which forms between the amino acids to form the secondary structures are usually the hydrogen bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It refers to the linear sequences, number and nature of amino acid. They are bonded by peptide bonds only. When there is folding in the linear polypeptide chain into the specific coiled structure it is known as a secondary structure. In the secondary structures, the hydrogen bonds are also formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Secondary Structure Secondary Structure refers to the coiling or folding of a polypeptide chain that gives the protein its 3-D shape. There are two types of secondary structures observed in proteins. One type is the alpha () helix structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Protein folding is the physical process by which a linear polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.
