<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder-a shape known as a double helix. Each strand has a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each molecule of DNA is a double helix formed from two complementary strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds between G-C and A-T base pairs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds between them, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds between them. Figure 22.2. 7: Hydrogen bonds form between complementary nitrogenous bases on the interior of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-DNA is made up of a double-stranded helix held together by weak hydrogen bonds between purine-pyrimidine nucleotide base pairs: adenine (A) paired with thymine (T), and guanine (G) paired with cytosine (C). Also called deoxyribonucleic acid.
