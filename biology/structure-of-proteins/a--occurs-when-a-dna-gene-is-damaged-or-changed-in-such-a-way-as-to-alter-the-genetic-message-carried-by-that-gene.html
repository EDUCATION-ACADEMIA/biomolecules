<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mutations result either from errors in DNA replication or from the damaging effects of mutagens, such as chemicals and radiation, which react with DNA and change the structures of individual nucleotides. All cells possess DNA-repair enzymes that attempt to minimize the number of mutations that occur (Section 14.2).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mutations are changes in the genetic sequence, and they are a main cause of diversity among organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-At the cellular level, damaged DNA that is not properly repaired can lead to genomic instability, apoptosis, or senescence, which can greatly affect the organismâ€™s development and ageing process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic mutations are changes to your DNA sequence that happen during cell division when your cells make copies of themselves. Your DNA tells your body how to form and function. Genetic mutations could lead to genetic conditions like cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A gene variant is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. This type of genetic change used to be known as a gene mutation, but because changes in DNA do not always cause disease, it is thought that gene variant is a more accurate term.
