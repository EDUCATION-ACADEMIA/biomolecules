<title>The term used to describe any case in which a proteins function at one site is affected by the binding of a regulatory molecule to a separate site. This may result in inhibition or stimulation of activity.

<meta name="description" content="Allostery is generally defined as the process of regulation of protein function due to the binding of an effector – a ligand or another protein – in a site on the protein surface referred to as an allosteric center [6].Allosteric regulation is the term used to describe any case in which a proteins function at one site is affected by the binding of a regulatory molecule to a separate site. It may result in either inhibition or stimulation of an enzymes activity.An allosteric site does not bind substrate, but instead binds another molecule that affects the enzymes regulation. When a molecule binds an allosteric site, it alters the enzymes shape, or conformation, which then changes how the enzyme functions.An inhibitor may bind to an enzyme and block binding of the substrate, for example, by attaching to the active site. This is called competitive inhibition, because the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the enzyme.Allosterism describes the change in the affinity for binding of a ligand or substrate that is caused by the binding of another ligand away from the active site (allosteric = other site).">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Allostery is generally defined as the process of regulation of protein function due to the binding of an effector – a ligand or another protein – in a site on the protein surface referred to as an allosteric center [6].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Allosteric regulation is the term used to describe any case in which a protein’s function at one site is affected by the binding of a regulatory molecule to a separate site. It may result in either inhibition or stimulation of an enzyme’s activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An allosteric site does not bind substrate, but instead binds another molecule that affects the enzyme’s regulation. When a molecule binds an allosteric site, it alters the enzyme’s shape, or conformation, which then changes how the enzyme functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An inhibitor may bind to an enzyme and block binding of the substrate, for example, by attaching to the active site. This is called competitive inhibition, because the inhibitor “competes” with the substrate for the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Allosterism describes the change in the affinity for binding of a ligand or substrate that is caused by the binding of another ligand away from the active site (allosteric = other site).
