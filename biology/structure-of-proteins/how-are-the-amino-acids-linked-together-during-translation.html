<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During translation, these tRNAs carry amino acids to the ribosome and join with their complementary codons. Then, the assembled amino acids are joined together as the ribosome, with its resident rRNAs, moves along the mRNA molecule in a ratchet-like motion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Within a protein, multiple amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, thereby forming a long chain. Peptide bonds are formed by a biochemical reaction that extracts a water molecule as it joins the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of a neighboring amino acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The amino acids in polypeptides are held together bypeptide bonds. Adipeptide is formed by a reaction between the -carboxyl and -amino groups of two amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In translation, the cell uses an mRNA strand that it has just transcribed from its genetic code as a template to assemble proteins. The cell has just transcribed this mRNA strand from its DNA, and it now translates the mRNA’s nucleotide sequence into a chain of amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The mRNA is then pulled through the ribosome; as its codons encounter the ribosome’s active site, the mRNA nucleotide sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the end of the growing polypeptide chain.
