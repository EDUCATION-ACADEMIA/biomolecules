<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The tertiary structure of a protein refers to the overall three-dimensional arrangement of its polypeptide chain in space. It is generally stabilized by outside polar hydrophilic hydrogen and ionic bond interactions, and internal hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar amino acid side chains (Fig.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Tertiary structure-the level of protein structure at which an entire polypeptide chain has folded into a three-dimensional structure. In multi-chain proteins, the term tertiary structure applies to the individual chains.
