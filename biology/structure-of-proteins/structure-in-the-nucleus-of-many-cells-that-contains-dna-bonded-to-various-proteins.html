<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Nuclear DNA does not appear in free linear strands; it is highly condensed and wrapped around nuclear proteins in order to fit inside the nucleus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A structure found inside the nucleus of a cell. A chromosome is made up of proteins and DNA organized into genes. Each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genes are small sections of DNA within the genome that code for proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-DNA and histone proteins are packaged into structures called chromosomes.
