<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Translation, as related to genomics, is the process through which information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA) directs the addition of amino acids during protein synthesis.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Translation, then, is one stage in the process in which the cell’s genetic information is used to create proteins. The cell’s DNA is first transcribed in a temporary copy (mRNA), which is then translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each group of three consecutive nucleotides in RNA is called a codon, and each codon specifies either one amino acid or a stop to the translation process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-At its heart, the genetic code is the set of “rules” that a cell uses to interpret the nucleotide sequence within a molecule of mRNA. This sequence is broken into a series of three-nucleotide units known as codons (Figure 1).
