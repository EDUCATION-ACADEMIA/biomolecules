<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Protein misfolding is believed to be the primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cystic fibrosis, Gaucher’s disease and many other degenerative and neurodegenerative disorders.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been identified as a proteopathy: a protein misfolding disease due to the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta (A) protein in the brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion protein diseases all share a common feature: the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins [1–3].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A characteristic of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s – collectively known as neurodegenerative diseases – is the build-up of misfolded proteins. These proteins, such as amyloid and tau in Alzheimer’s disease, form ‘aggregates’ that can cause irreversible damage to nerve cells in the brain.
