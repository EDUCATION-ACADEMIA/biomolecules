<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amino acids have a central asymmetric carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain (R group) are attached.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Each of the 20 amino acids has a specific side chain, known as an R group, that is also attached to the carbon. The R groups have a variety of shapes, sizes, charges, and reactivities. This allows amino acids to be grouped according to the chemical properties of their side chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The R-group dictates the properties (size and structure) and nature of the amino acid (polarity). It determines if the amino acid is considered acidic, polar, nonpolar, basic, or neutral. The R-group can also help to predict the behaviour and the reactivity of the amino acid in a reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-At the “center” of each amino acid is a carbon called the carbon and attached to it are four groups-a hydrogen, an -carboxyl group, an -amine group, and an R-group, sometimes referred to as a side chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures.
