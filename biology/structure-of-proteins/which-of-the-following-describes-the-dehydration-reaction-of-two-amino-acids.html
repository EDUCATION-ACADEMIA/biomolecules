<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In a dehydration synthesis reaction, the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a molecule of water (Figure 3.2). At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds. As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It is a peptide bond formation reaction which occurs between two amino acid molecules. The amino group of one molecule and carboxyl group of another molecule condenses with the elimination of water molecules and form an amide linkage in dipeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A peptide bond is formed by a dehydration synthesis or reaction at a molecular level. This reaction is also known as a condensation reaction which usually occurs between amino acids. As depicted in the figure given below, two amino acids bond together to form a peptide bond by the dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A peptide bond (CO-NH) is a chemical bond produced by attaching the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another, forming a peptide chain. Since a water molecule is released to form a peptide bond, the process is referred to as dehydration synthesis.
