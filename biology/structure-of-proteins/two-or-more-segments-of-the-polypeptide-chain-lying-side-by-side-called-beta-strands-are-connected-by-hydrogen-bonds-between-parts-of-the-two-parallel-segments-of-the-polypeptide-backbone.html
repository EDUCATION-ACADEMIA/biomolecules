<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The other common secondary structure is the beta-pleated sheet. In this structure, two different regions of a polypeptide chain lie side by side and are bound by hydrogen bonds. They make up the core of many globular proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Quaternary structure However, some proteins are made up of multiple polypeptide chains, also known as subunits. When these subunits come together, they give the protein its quaternary structure. We’ve already encountered one example of a protein with quaternary structure: hemoglobin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Quaternary Structure of Protein Some of the proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains referred to as sub-units. The spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quaternary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An -helix secondary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl oxygen and the amino group of every third residue in the helical turn with each helical turn consisting of 3.6 amino acid residues (Fig. 10.1A). The side chain of amino acids is projected outward from the outer helical surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hemoglobin has a quaternary structure. It consists of two pairs of different proteins, designated the and chains. There are 141 and 146 amino acids in the and chains of hemoglobin, respectively.
