<title>Which of the following identifies the number of water molecules needed to remove the amino acids from a polypeptide with 20 amino acids?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: The answer is 6 water molecules. The formation of a peptide bond is a condensation reaction where two amino acids condense together and form a peptide bond.Peptide bond: A covalent bond joining the Î±-amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of another with the loss of a water molecule.Following this pattern, we can conclude that the number of water molecules lost is equal to the number of amino acids joined together, minus 1.1 Answer. Between two amino acids, one water molecule is eliminated and a peptide bond is formed. When 500 amino acids are joined to form a polypeptide, 250 molecules of water will be removed.">
