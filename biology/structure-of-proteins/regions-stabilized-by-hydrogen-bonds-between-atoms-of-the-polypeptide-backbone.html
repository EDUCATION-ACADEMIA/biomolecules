<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The other common secondary structure is the beta-pleated sheet. In this structure, two different regions of a polypeptide chain lie side by side and are bound by hydrogen bonds. They make up the core of many globular proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another. Images showing hydrogen bonding patterns in beta pleated sheets and alpha helices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The structure of protein in which hydrogen bonds begin to form between the polypeptide backbone is the secondary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-1.2. 2 Secondary structure. Secondary structure refers to regular, recurring arrangements in space of adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. It is maintained by hydrogen bonds between amide hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens of the peptide backbone.
