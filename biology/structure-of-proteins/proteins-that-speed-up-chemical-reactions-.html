<meta name="description" content="An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein.

Although RNAs are capable of catalyzing some reactions, most biological reactions are catalyzed by proteins.For the first time, scientists have used machine learning to create brand-new enzymes, which are proteins that accelerate chemical reactions. This is an important step in the field of protein design as new enzymes could have many uses across medicine and industrial manufacturing.Enzymes are mainly globular proteins-protein molecules where the tertiary structure has given the molecule a generally rounded, ball shape (although perhaps a very squashed ball in some cases).

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein. It speeds up the rate of a specific chemical reaction in the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A fundamental task of proteins is to act as enzymes-catalysts that increase the rate of virtually all the chemical reactions within cells. Although RNAs are capable of catalyzing some reactions, most biological reactions are catalyzed by proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-For the first time, scientists have used machine learning to create brand-new enzymes, which are proteins that accelerate chemical reactions. This is an important step in the field of protein design as new enzymes could have many uses across medicine and industrial manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes are mainly globular proteins-protein molecules where the tertiary structure has given the molecule a generally rounded, ball shape (although perhaps a very squashed ball in some cases). The other type of proteins (fibrous proteins) have long thin structures and are found in tissues like muscle and hair.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range.
