<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As heat denatured the proteins in the egg white, it broke apart some of the bonds (mostly hydrogen bonds) that were holding the proteins in their original shape. The proteins unfolded, taking up more space (turning the gel white) and hardening them in place next to one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If egg whites are beaten until they are stiff, they are fully denatured and have no elasticity; they lose their original properties and aren’t able to return to their former state. If egg whites are beaten only until they form soft peaks, the proteins are only partially denatured and retain some of their elasticity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cloudy egg white – Cloudiness is actually an indication that your egg is very fresh. High levels of carbon dioxide cause cloudiness when the egg is laid. With time, cloudiness clears. These eggs are safe to eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When the egg gets heated up, these liquids undergo a chemical change. The proteins unravel and bind to one another, which results in a network of proteins that traps water. During this time, the yolk and egg white become gel-like flexible solids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The eggs salted in a brine solution containing a higher salt concentration have a higher salt content in the egg white, which dissociates the structure of the ovomucin and causes the egg white to thin and decreases the ovomucin level, leading to an increased pH value in the egg white.
