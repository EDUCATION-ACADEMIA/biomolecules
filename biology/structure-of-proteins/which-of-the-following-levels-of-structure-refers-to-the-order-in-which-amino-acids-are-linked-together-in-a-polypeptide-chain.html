<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Primary structure. The simplest level of protein structure, primary structure, is simply the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Primary Structure (1˚) The primary structure of a peptide or protein is the linear sequence of its amino acids (AAs). By convention, the primary structure of a protein is read and written from the amino-terminal (N) to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. Each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A protein’s primary structure refers to the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain. Peptide bonds that are made during the protein biosynthesis process hold the primary structure together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Primary structure refers to the linear sequence of the amino acids connected by the peptide bonds. The secondary structure consists of local packing of polypeptide chain into -helices and -sheets due to hydrogen bonds between peptide bond – central carbon backbone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The actual order of the amino acids in the protein is called its primary structure and is determined by DNA. The order of deoxyribonucleotide bases in a gene determines the amino acid sequence of a particular protein.
