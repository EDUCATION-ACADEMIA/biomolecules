<title>Enzymes ..... the activation energy of a chemical reaction.
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example: Enzymes bring reactants together so they dont have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random.Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.Fortunately, its possible to lower the activation energy of a reaction, and to thereby increase reaction rate. The process of speeding up a reaction by reducing its activation energy is known as catalysis, and the factor thats added to lower the activation energy is called a catalyst.Enzymes perform the critical task of lowering a reactions activation energy-that is, the amount of energy that must be put in for the reaction to begin. Enzymes work by binding to reactant molecules and holding them in such a way that the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example: Enzymes bring reactants together so they don’t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fortunately, it’s possible to lower the activation energy of a reaction, and to thereby increase reaction rate. The process of speeding up a reaction by reducing its activation energy is known as catalysis, and the factor that’s added to lower the activation energy is called a catalyst.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes perform the critical task of lowering a reaction’s activation energy-that is, the amount of energy that must be put in for the reaction to begin. Enzymes work by binding to reactant molecules and holding them in such a way that the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily.
