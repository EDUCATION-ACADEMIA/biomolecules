<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Definition. By definition, the transition state is the transitory of molecular structure in which the molecule is no longer a substrate but not yet a product. All chemical reactions must go through the transition state to form a product from a substrate molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-By binding substrates to their active sites, enzymes stabilize the structure of the transition state. This in turn lowers of the free energy of the transition state, which in turn decreases the rate of the chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The transition state is a high-energy state, and some amount of energy – the activation energy – must be added in order for the molecule reach it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The substrate has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state in case of: 1. Exothermic reactions only.
