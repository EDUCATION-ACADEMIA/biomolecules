<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex. The products then leave the active site of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The enzyme is released unchanged and can be used for another reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are not reactants and are not used up during the reaction. Once an enzyme binds to a substrate and catalyzes the reaction, the enzyme is released, unchanged, and can be used for another reaction. This means that for each reaction, there does not need to be a 1:1 ratio between enzyme and substrate molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The enzyme will always return to its original state at the completion of the reaction. One of the important properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes are commonly named by adding a suffix “-ase” to the root name of the substrate molecule they will naturally be acting upon. For example, Lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of lipids, they break down the molecule with the help of water; Sucrase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose.
