<title>Is it possible for two meals that contain the same number of calories to have different amounts of energy?

<meta name="description" content="Yes, by definition, a calorie is the same no matter what you eat. As defined, a calorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 kilogram of water by 1℃, so technically, 100 calories of cake offers the same amount of energy as 100 calories of kale.How much energy they provide depends on the amount of carbohydrate (sugars/starch), protein, fat and alcohol the food or drink contains, as well as the portion size. Different ingredients in food and how they are prepared mean some have more kilojoules than others. Larger serving sizes also mean more kilojoules.Although every persons daily caloric intake is individual, based on their personal goals and needs, nutrition experts estimate that average daily consumption at each meal should be broken down as follows: 300 to 400 calories for breakfast, and 500 to 700 calories each for lunch and dinner.Fat has more than twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins. A gram of fat has about 9 calories, while a gram of carbohydrate or protein has about 4 calories. In other words, you could eat twice as much carbohydrates or proteins as fat for the same amount of calories.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Yes, by definition, a calorie is the same no matter what you eat. As defined, a calorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 kilogram of water by 1℃, so technically, 100 calories of cake offers the same amount of energy as 100 calories of kale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-How much energy they provide depends on the amount of carbohydrate (sugars/starch), protein, fat and alcohol the food or drink contains, as well as the portion size. Different ingredients in food and how they are prepared mean some have more kilojoules than others. Larger serving sizes also mean more kilojoules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Although every person’s daily caloric intake is individual, based on their personal goals and needs, nutrition experts estimate that average daily consumption at each meal should be broken down as follows: 300 to 400 calories for breakfast, and 500 to 700 calories each for lunch and dinner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fat has more than twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins. A gram of fat has about 9 calories, while a gram of carbohydrate or protein has about 4 calories. In other words, you could eat twice as much carbohydrates or proteins as fat for the same amount of calories.
