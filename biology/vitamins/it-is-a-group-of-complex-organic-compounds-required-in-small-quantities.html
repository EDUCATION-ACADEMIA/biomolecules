<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Vitamins are organic compounds that people need in small quantities. Most vitamins need to come from food because the body either does not produce them or produces very little.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term “vitamin” is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-These compounds are called vitamins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Vitamins are organic compounds which are essential for maintenance of normal growth and health of the organism. Certain vitamins cannot be stored in our body and have to be supplied regularly in diet while others can be stored in the body. Vitamins are required only in small amounts and should not be taken in excess.
