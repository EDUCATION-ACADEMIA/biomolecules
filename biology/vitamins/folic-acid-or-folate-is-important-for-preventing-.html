<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When the baby is developing early during pregnancy, folic acid helps form the neural tube. Folic acid is very important because it can help prevent some major birth defects of the baby’s brain (anencephaly) and spine (spina bifida). The neural tube forms the early brain and spine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The body needs folate to function normally. Most children and adults get enough folate through their diet. Choose a wide variety of foods to get the best range of nutrients. Women who are planning to become pregnant or who are in the early stages of pregnancy should take a folic acid supplement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It is easier for the body to form healthy cells using folic acid than using natural food folate. Folic acid can be measured in mcg DFE or in mcg (1.67 mcg DFE is the same as 1 mcg of folic acid).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Folate is a B group vitamin needed for healthy growth and development. It is known as ‘folate’ when it is found naturally in food, such as leafy green vegetables, fruits and legumes. ‘Folic acid’ is the synthetic form of folate and is added to food, such as bread and breakfast cereals, or used in dietary supplements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Folic Acid Can Help Prevent Birth Defects Folic acid can reduce certain birth defects of the brain and spinal cord by more than 70 percent. These birth defects are called neural tube defects (NTDs). NTDs happen when the spinal cord fails to close properly.
