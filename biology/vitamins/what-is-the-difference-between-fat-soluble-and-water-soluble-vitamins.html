Fat-soluble vitamins get absorbed by fats and travel through the bloodstream while water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and get absorbed by tissues immediately.Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water, which means these vitamins and nutrients dissolve quickly in the body. Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins are carried to the bodys tissues, but the body cannot store them. Any excess amounts of water-soluble vitamins simply pass through the body.Fat-soluble vitamins are most abundant in high fat foods and are much better absorbed into your bloodstream when you eat them with fat. Most vitamins are water-soluble, meaning they dissolve in water. In contrast, fat-soluble vitamins are similar to oil and do not dissolve in water.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-While water-soluble vitamins are quickly absorbed with the excess being released, fat-soluble vitamins are slower to dissolve, and the excess is stored in the liver. This means that excessive amounts of fat-soluble vitamin supplements can cause problems such as vitamin toxicity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Q. What is the difference between fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins? A. Fat-soluble vitamins get absorbed by fats and travel through the bloodstream while water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and get absorbed by tissues immediately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water, which means these vitamins and nutrients dissolve quickly in the body. Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins are carried to the bodyâ€™s tissues, but the body cannot store them. Any excess amounts of water-soluble vitamins simply pass through the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fat-soluble vitamins are most abundant in high fat foods and are much better absorbed into your bloodstream when you eat them with fat. Most vitamins are water-soluble, meaning they dissolve in water. In contrast, fat-soluble vitamins are similar to oil and do not dissolve in water.
