<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, fat and protein are called macronutrients. They are the nutrients you use in the largest amounts. “Macronutrients are the nutritive components of food that the body needs for energy and to maintain the body’s structure and systems, ” says MD Anderson Wellness Dietitian Lindsey Wohlford.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Macros are macronutrients. Your body needs these nutrients in larger amounts in order to function properly as macro means large. In addition, all of these nutrients provide your body with energy measured in the form of calories or kcals. There are three types of macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Macronutrients are the nutrients we need in larger quantities that provide us with energy: in other words, fat, protein and carbohydrate. Micronutrients are mostly vitamins and minerals, and are equally important but consumed in very small amounts. We generally get our micronutrients along with macronutrients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Macronutrients, or “macros, ” are nutrients your body needs in large amounts to function optimally. Carbs, protein, and fat are the three main macros. Macronutrients are a group of nutrients that provide your body with energy and the components it needs to maintain its structure and functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, fat, and protein are macronutrients. Micronutrients, however, are needed in smaller amounts, and these include vitamins and minerals. Macronutrients provide your body with energy.
