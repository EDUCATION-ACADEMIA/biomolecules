<strong> What characterizes saturated fats? 
</strong>
<p>(A) They contain one or more double bonds between carbon atoms within the fatty acid. 
</p>
<p>(B) They originate from plant-based foods such as avocado and cashew nuts. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** They have no double bonds between the individual carbon atoms of the fatty acid. 
</p>
<p>(D) They are often found as liquids at room temperature. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Saturated fatty acid refers to a type of fatty acid that has no linkages of unsaturated between carbon atoms. This type of fatty acid cannot absorb more hydrogen due to the lack of double bonds. Moreover, these types of acids commonly exist in the fats of animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fatty acid chains with no double bonds are saturated, because each carbon is saturated with as many bonded hydrogen atoms as possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Saturated fats are made up of chains of carbon molecules that do not contain any double bonds between the carbon molecules. Therefore, these carbon molecules contain the highest number of hydrogen atoms possible. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature, do not spoil quickly, and have high melting points.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between carbons, whereas unsaturated fatty acids have one or more of these double bonds. In this way, the hydrocarbon chains are “saturated” with hydrogen atoms (since each double bond reduces the number of hydrogen atoms bound to carbons).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Unsaturated fats contain at least one double bond in the chain, whereas saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms.
