<title>What are the main uses of Glucose in plants?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Glucose is used for respiration (aerobic and anaerobic). It is also converted into starch so that it can be stored for future energy needs. It is stored in the stem, leaves and roots. Glucose is also used to produce fat/oils to be stored, particularly in seeds.Glucose is used by plants for energy and to make other substances like cellulose and starch. Cellulose is used in building cell walls. Starch is stored in seeds and other plant parts as a food source. Thats why some foods that we eat, like rice and grains, are packed with starch!Glucose can used as a substrate and broken down in plant cells by the process of respiration. The chemical energy released by respiration can be used by the plant for cellular activities such as protein synthesis or cell division.WHAT DO PLANTS USE GLUCOSE FOR? RESPIRATION, MAKING FRUITS, MAKING CELL WALLS, MAKING PROTEINS, STORED IN SEEDS AND STORED AS STARCH.Since glucose is a reactive compound thus plants do not store their food in the form of glucose. Therefore, before storing the food, plants convert it into sucrose and it is stored further.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Glucose is used for respiration (aerobic and anaerobic). It is also converted into starch so that it can be stored for future energy needs. It is stored in the stem, leaves and roots. Glucose is also used to produce fat/oils to be stored, particularly in seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Glucose is used by plants for energy and to make other substances like cellulose and starch. Cellulose is used in building cell walls. Starch is stored in seeds and other plant parts as a food source. Thatâ€™s why some foods that we eat, like rice and grains, are packed with starch!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Glucose can used as a substrate and broken down in plant cells by the process of respiration. The chemical energy released by respiration can be used by the plant for cellular activities such as protein synthesis or cell division.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-WHAT DO PLANTS USE GLUCOSE FOR? RESPIRATION, MAKING FRUITS, MAKING CELL WALLS, MAKING PROTEINS, STORED IN SEEDS AND STORED AS STARCH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Since glucose is a reactive compound thus plants do not store their food in the form of glucose. Therefore, before storing the food, plants convert it into sucrose and it is stored further.
