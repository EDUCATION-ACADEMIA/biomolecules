<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A fat molecule is made up of a glycerol molecule along with three molecules of fatty acid molecules. As the fat molecules are made up of a single glycerol molecule with three fatty acid molecules, it is also known as triglycerides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Triacylglycerol (Triglyceride) Triacylglycerol is the major form of dietary lipid in fats and oils, whether derived from plants or animals. Triacylglycerol is composed of three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol molecule (Figure 4).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are esters formed from one glycerol and three fatty acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through the oxygen atom. During the ester bond formation, three molecules are released. Since fats consist of three fatty acids and a glycerol, they are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides.
