<strong> When we eat disaccharides, our cells do what first before energy is obtained? 
</strong>
<p>(A) make the disaccharide a polysaccharide 
</p>
<p>(B) ** break the disaccharides down to monosaccharides 
</p>
<p>(C) leave the disaccharides as is, and obtain energy 
</p>
<p>(D) throw the disaccharide out, because we canâ€™t use it.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As disaccharides travel through the body they are broken down into simple sugars, or monosaccharides, by a process called hydrolysis. This process is facilitated by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases. These different enzymes help to break down different types of sugars in the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Disaccharides act as an energy source for the body, just like any other carbohydrate. When we eat foods that contain disaccharides, our bodies break them down into simple sugars (monosaccharides) for absorption in the small intestine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The primary goal of carbohydrate digestion is to break down polysaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides that can then be converted to glucose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When disaccharides are broken down into their monosaccharide components via enzymes, a water molecule is added. This process is called hydrolysis. It should not be confused with the process of dissolution, which happens when sugar is dissolved in water, for example.
