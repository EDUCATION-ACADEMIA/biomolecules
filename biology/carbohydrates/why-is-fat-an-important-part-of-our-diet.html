<title>Why is fat an important part of our diet?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. Fat is a source of essential fatty acids, which the body cannot make itself. Fat helps the body absorb vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they can only be absorbed with the help of fats.Fats and health You need some fat in your diet to help the body absorb certain nutrients. Fat is a source of energy, and provides essential fatty acids that the body cant make itself. Any fat that your body does not use for energy is converted into body fat. Eating too much fat can therefore lead to weight gain.Because lipids include a high percentage of C-H bonds, which store chemical potential energy more effectively than other molecules, fats have a substantially higher energy density than carbohydrates. Hence, fats contain more energy per gram than carbohydrates.Fat is the bodys most concentrated source of energy, providing more than twice as much potential energy as carbohydrate or protein (9 calories per gram versus 4 calories each per gram). During exercise, stored fat in the body (in the form of triglycerides in adipose or fat tissue) is broken down into fatty acids.White fat is specialized to store energy in the form of triglycerides, an especially efficient method because this class of molecules is highly energetic and stored anhydrously. On fasting, the release of fatty acids and glycerol to provide fuel for the rest of the body occurs via enzymatic hydrolysis called lipolysis.">

<strong> Why is fat an important part of our diet? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Because it tastes good 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Because it carries so much energy 
</p>
<p>(C) Because it contains nutrients you can’t get from anything else 
</p>
<p>(D) Because it contains oxygen atoms

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. Fat is a source of essential fatty acids, which the body cannot make itself. Fat helps the body absorb vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they can only be absorbed with the help of fats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fats and health You need some fat in your diet to help the body absorb certain nutrients. Fat is a source of energy, and provides essential fatty acids that the body can’t make itself. Any fat that your body does not use for energy is converted into body fat. Eating too much fat can therefore lead to weight gain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Because lipids include a high percentage of C-H bonds, which store chemical potential energy more effectively than other molecules, fats have a substantially higher energy density than carbohydrates. Hence, fats contain more energy per gram than carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fat is the body’s most concentrated source of energy, providing more than twice as much potential energy as carbohydrate or protein (9 calories per gram versus 4 calories each per gram). During exercise, stored fat in the body (in the form of triglycerides in adipose or fat tissue) is broken down into fatty acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-White fat is specialized to store energy in the form of triglycerides, an especially efficient method because this class of molecules is highly energetic and stored anhydrously. On fasting, the release of fatty acids and glycerol to provide fuel for the rest of the body occurs via enzymatic hydrolysis called lipolysis.
