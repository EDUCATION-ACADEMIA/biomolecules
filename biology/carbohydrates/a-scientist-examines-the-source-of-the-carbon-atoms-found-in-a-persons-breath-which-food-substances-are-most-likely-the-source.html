<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In most living species, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fats are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Fats supply your body with energy, form your cells, maintain body temperature, and protect your nerves. A nutrient that provides energy and helps the body store and use vitamins is a fat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The organic compounds which are the main source of energy in any living being are lipids and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are nutrients that are used frequently and get converted into energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-1) Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, butter, milk, cheese, and some meats.
