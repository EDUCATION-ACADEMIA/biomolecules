<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Polymers are broken down into monomers via hydrolysis reactions, in which a bond is broken, or lysed, by addition of a water molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A monomer is a single atom, small molecule, or molecular fragment that, when bonded together with identical and similar types of monomers, form a larger, macromolecule known as a polymer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Polymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means “to split water, ” a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown. During these reactions, the polymer is broken into two components.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Polymers are large molecules made up of many subunits called monomers linked together to form a chain. Therefore, the relationship between monomers and polymers is that polymers are made up of monomers. For example, proteins are all made up of a polymer known as a polypeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Polymers are chains of monomers. Condensation and hydrolysis create or break up these monomers forming new polymers. List the macromolecules that are made and broken down by condensation and hydrolysis reactions, respectively.
