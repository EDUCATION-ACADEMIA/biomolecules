<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-2: Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all hexoses. They are structural isomers, meaning they have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6) but a different arrangement of atoms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently. Carbohydrates have many isomers because of the arrangement of the −OH groups in their structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Galactose is a monosaccharide and has the same chemical formula as glucose, i.e., C6H12O6. It is similar to glucose in its structure, differing only in the position of one hydroxyl group. This difference, however, gives galactose different chemical and biochemical properties to glucose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Glucose and galactose are stereoisomers (have atoms bonded together in the same order, but differently arranged in space). They differ in their stereochemistry at carbon 4. Fructose is a structural isomer of glucose and galactose (has the same atoms, but bonded together in a different order).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Galactose is the isomer of glucose. They differ only in the organization of their atoms. Glucose and galactose are stereoisomers of each other. The main structural difference in between galactose and glucose is the orientation of the hydroxyl group (OH) at carbon 4.
