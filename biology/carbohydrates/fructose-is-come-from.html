<meta name="description" content="Where does fructose come from? Sometimes called fruit sugar, fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found primarily in fruits (such as apples, dates, figs, pears and prunes), but also in vegetables (such as artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, onions and red peppers), honey, sugar beets and sugar cane.Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a monosaccharide like glucose ( 1 ). Its naturally found in fruit, honey, agave, and most root vegetables. Moreover, its commonly added to processed foods in the form of high fructose corn syrup.Natural sugars are found in fruit as fructose and in dairy products as lactose. Many dietitians recommend eating six to nine half-cup servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Dairy products with lactose include milk, yogurt and cheese, which are also high in protein.Studies have shown fructose does not have any specific effects on the body that causes weight gain or obesity when consumed in line with sugars; however, the fact that fructose is a naturally occurring sugar in fruits and vegetables means its much harder to consume high levels of fructose in its natural state.Fructose is harmful only in large amounts, and its difficult to get excessive amounts of fructose from fruit. For most people, the amount of sugar in fruit is safe to eat. Evidence suggests that fructose can cause harm when consumed in excess.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Where does fructose come from? Sometimes called “fruit sugar, ” fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found primarily in fruits (such as apples, dates, figs, pears and prunes), but also in vegetables (such as artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, onions and red peppers), honey, sugar beets and sugar cane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fructose, or “fruit sugar, ” is a monosaccharide like glucose ( 1 ). It’s naturally found in fruit, honey, agave, and most root vegetables. Moreover, it’s commonly added to processed foods in the form of high fructose corn syrup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Natural sugars are found in fruit as fructose and in dairy products as lactose. Many dietitians recommend eating six to nine half-cup servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Dairy products with lactose include milk, yogurt and cheese, which are also high in protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Studies have shown fructose does not have any specific effects on the body that causes weight gain or obesity when consumed in line with sugars; however, the fact that fructose is a naturally occurring sugar in fruits and vegetables means it’s much harder to consume high levels of fructose in its natural state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fructose is harmful only in large amounts, and it’s difficult to get excessive amounts of fructose from fruit. For most people, the amount of sugar in fruit is safe to eat. Evidence suggests that fructose can cause harm when consumed in excess. However, there is not enough fructose in fruit to cause concern.
