<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-To reiterate, the primary structure of a protein is defined as the sequence of amino acids linked together to form a polypeptide chain. Each amino acid is linked to the next amino acid through peptide bonds created during the protein biosynthesis process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Each protein or peptide consists of a linear sequence of amino acids. The protein primary structure conventionally begins at the amino-terminal (N) end and continues until the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. The structure of a protein may be directly sequenced or inferred from the sequence of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The linear sequence of amino acids within a protein is considered the primary structure of the protein. Proteins are built from a set of only twenty amino acids, each of which has a unique side chain. The side chains of amino acids have different chemistries. The largest group of amino acids have nonpolar side chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Sequence of Amino Acids in a Protein Determines Its Folded Structure. The specific order of amino acids in a protein is known as its primary structure. It is this sequence that determines the three-dimensional architecture of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The primary structure of a protein necessarily linear (rather than branched) sequence of amino acids because it is able to coil and fold upon itself, resulting in 3D formations such as alpha helices and beta sheets.
