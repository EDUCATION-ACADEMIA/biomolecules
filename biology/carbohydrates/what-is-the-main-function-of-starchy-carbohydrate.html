<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Starchy foods are the primary source of carbohydrates for most people. They play a crucial role in a nutritious, well-balanced diet, as they provide the body with glucose, which is the main energy source for every cell. They also provide a range of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Starchy foods are the main source of carbohydrate and play an important role in a healthy diet. They are also a good source of energy and the main source of a range of nutrients in your diet. As well as starch, they contain fibre, calcium, iron and B vitamins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Starch has significant value for humans: it serves as the main carbohydrate source in an equilibrated diet and as a renewable raw material for industry. For instance, starch is extensively used as a thickener and texturizer in processed foods, as it gelatinizes to form pastes when heated in water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-They can also contain fiber, vitamins, minerals, naturally occurring sugars, and more. Because they are high in starch, a carbohydrate, starchy foods provide the body with readily available energy. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in a person’s diet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Role of Carbohydrates: From Energy to Gut Health They’re the body’s primary source of energy and the brain’s preferred energy source. Carbs are broken down by the body into glucose – a type of sugar. Glucose is used as fuel by your body’s cells, tissues, and organs.
