<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Glucose is the main source of fuel for our cells. When the body doesn’t need to use the glucose for energy, it stores it in the liver and muscles. This stored form of glucose is made up of many connected glucose molecules and is called glycogen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Glycogen is a ubiquitous fuel source stored in the cytosol of cells, occupying 2% of the volume of cardiac cells, 10 1%–2% of the volume of skeletal muscle cells, and 5%–6% of the volume of liver cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Glycogen is a homopolysaccharide found in the liver and muscles of animals, where it is used to store energy. Chemically, glycogen is related to starch and closely resembles amylopectin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In animal cells, glucose is generally stored in the form of glycogen. This is done to not upset the osmotic balances in the cell. Glucose molecules are soluble in water and thus can cause the cell to become hypertonic. This will result in the entry of water molecules within the cells and cause it to lyse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Glucose that is not needed for energy is stored in the form of glycogen as a source of potential energy, readily available when needed. Most glycogen is stored in the liver and in muscle cells.
