<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The main difference between alpha and beta glucose is that the –OH group attached to the first carbon atom in alpha glucose is located on the same side as the –CH2OH group whereas the –OH group attached to the first carbon atom of in beta glucose is located on the opposite side from the –CH2OH group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The glucose has two isomers, alpha glucose and beta glucose. The main difference between the two lies in the orientation of the (-OH) hydroxyl group. In both cases, the hydroxyl group gets connected to the first carbon atom, just the geometry is different.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>- glucose and glucose are structurally identical except with the difference in the “configuration” of the anomeric carbon atom. So, they are also called as anomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The form melts at 146°C and has a specific rotation of +112°, while the form melts at 150°C and has a specific rotation of +18.7°.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An alpha-glycosidic bond is formed when both carbons have the same stereochemistry, whereas a beta-glycosidic bond occurs when the two carbons have different stereochemistry.
