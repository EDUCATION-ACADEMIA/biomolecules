<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The reason is carbon’s ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules. In fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Carbon is phenomenally important to life as we understand it. The ability to form bonds with up to four different atoms gives carbon an incredible chemical diversity, and allows for carbon to make long chains and aromatic compounds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What are the characteristics of carbon that make possible the building of such a wide variety of organic molecules? Carbon has four valence electrons. It can form four different bonds with other carbon atoms or other atoms. Carbon can form chains, branches, rings – a wide variety of shapes!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The bonding properties of carbon For one thing, carbon-carbon bonds are unusually strong, so carbon can form a stable, sturdy backbone for a large molecule. Perhaps more important, however, is carbon’s capacity for covalent bonding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Characteristics of Carbon Carbon makes 4 electrons to form a covalent bond. It has a number of allotropes and other forms of existence. These include diamond and graphite with distinctive properties. Carbon is highly unreactive under conditions that are normal.
