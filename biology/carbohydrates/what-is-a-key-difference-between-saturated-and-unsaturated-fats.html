<strong> What is a key difference between saturated and unsaturated fats? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Saturated fats are usually liquid at room temperature; unsaturated fats are usually solid 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Saturated fats stay solid at room temperature; unsaturated fats are usually liquid 
</p>
<p>(C) Saturated fats can be found in vegetable oils; unsaturated fats can be found in animal products 
</p>
<p>(D) Saturated fats are healthier than unsaturated fats

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Saturated fats (including a type called trans fat) tend to stay solid and can cause fatty deposits in blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis ("hardening of the arteries"). By contrast, unsaturated fats stay liquid at room temperature and are less likely to clog your arteries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Saturated fatty acids lack double bonds between the individual carbon atoms, while in unsaturated fatty acids there is at least one double bond in the fatty acid chain. Saturated fats tend to be solid at room temperature and from animal sources, while unsaturated fats are usually liquid and from plant sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The building blocks of unsaturated fats have bends or kinks that donâ€™t allow the blocks to be tightly stacked and thus, appear more fluid and are liquid at room temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Saturated fats have a chain like structure which allows them to stack very well forming a solid at room temperature.
