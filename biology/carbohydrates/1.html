<strong> Cellulose differs from starch in that 
</strong>
<p>(A) cellulose is highly branched, whereas starch is unbranched. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** most animals cannot break down cellulose, whereas starch is easily digested. 
</p>
<p>(C) starch is made of glucose monomers, whereas cellulose is made of fructose monomers. 
</p>
<p>(D) starch is formed by plants and cellulose by animals.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-To digest starch is easy for the human body but not cellulose because our body does not contain necessary enzymes that help the digestion of cellulose but there are some enzymes that can digest starch because such enzymes are able to break alpha linkage of starch. Bond cannot be digested by our intestines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Your body contains enzymes that break starch down into glucose to fuel your body. But we humans donâ€™t have enzymes that can break down cellulose. Some animals do, like termites who eat wood, or cattle who eat grass and break down cellulose in their four-chambered stomachs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Starch and cellulose are both polymers of glucose. Starch is highly digestible by plants and animals. Cellulose, however, is not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The difference between cellulose and starch is that starch is a branched polymer, while cellulose is a linear polymer. Both starches and cellulose are made of glucose molecules, but the difference between them is that starch is a branched polymer, while cellulose is a linear polymer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-cellulose, a carbohydrate, is a common constituent of all plants. Despite its widespread prevalence, most animals are unable to directly digest it in their own stomachs, because they lack a key gene to enable them to do so.
