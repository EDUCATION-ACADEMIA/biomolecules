<title>What does the leavening agent do?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="A leavening agent is a substance that causes dough to expand by releasing gas once mixed with liquid, acid or heat. Rising agents give baked goods optimal volume, texture and crumb and can include baking soda or baking powder, whipped egg whites or cream, active or instant dry yeast, and even steam.During fermentation, carbon dioxide is produced and trapped as tiny pockets of air within the dough. This causes it to rise. During baking the carbon dioxide expands and causes the bread to rise further. The alcohol produced during fermentation evaporates during the bread baking process.Biological leavening agents, the most famous of which is yeast, are commonly used in the bread making process. During fermentation, biological leavening agents break down the sugars in bread dough and produce carbon dioxide gas and flavor compounds to lift and flavor your baked goods.In the presence of warmth and moisture, yeast converts food-sugar and starch-into carbon dioxide and alcohol through fermentation. Its the carbon dioxide that makes baked goods rise. The essentials of any bread dough are flour, water, and of course, yeast.Leavening is what makes bread rise or lighten, causing that delicious flaky or chewy texture that we love so much. There are a few things that leaven dough or batter, and the right one depends on your desired result.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A leavening agent is a substance that causes dough to expand by releasing gas once mixed with liquid, acid or heat. Rising agents give baked goods optimal volume, texture and crumb and can include baking soda or baking powder, whipped egg whites or cream, active or instant dry yeast, and even steam.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During fermentation, carbon dioxide is produced and trapped as tiny pockets of air within the dough. This causes it to rise. During baking the carbon dioxide expands and causes the bread to rise further. The alcohol produced during fermentation evaporates during the bread baking process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Biological leavening agents, the most famous of which is yeast, are commonly used in the bread making process. During fermentation, biological leavening agents break down the sugars in bread dough and produce carbon dioxide gas and flavor compounds to lift and flavor your baked goods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the presence of warmth and moisture, yeast converts food-sugar and starch-into carbon dioxide and alcohol through fermentation. It’s the carbon dioxide that makes baked goods rise. The essentials of any bread dough are flour, water, and of course, yeast.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Leavening is what makes bread “rise” or lighten, causing that delicious flaky or chewy texture that we love so much. There are a few things that leaven dough or batter, and the right one depends on your desired result.
