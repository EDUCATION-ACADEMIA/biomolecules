<title>What is the purpose of flour in quick breads?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Flour provides the structure in baked goods. Wheat flour contains proteins that interact with each other when mixed with water, forming gluten. It is this elastic gluten framework which stretches to contain the expanding leavening gases during rising. The protein content of a flour affects the strength of a dough.During baking, the egg proteins coagulate (go from liquid state to solid state) giving the batter or dough elasticity and structure.As the name suggests, all-purpose flour is suitable for all types of baked goods such as bread, biscuits, pizza, cookies, muffins, etc. It is also used in thickening gravies and sauces. Due to bran removal and loss of nutrients, all purpose flour is usually enriched with vitamins and minerals.The two proteins of importance are gliadin and glutenin. Glutenin is responsible for the elasticity of the dough while gliadin is responsible for dough extensibility. This makes gluten elastic and plastic, allowing it to expand when gas is formed during fermentation.When flour made from grinding these grains is mixed with water the two proteins combine and form gluten. Without water, gluten is not formed. The more the dough is mixed, the more gluten is developed. This causes the dough to become elastic and stretchy, as can be seen in bread dough.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Flour provides the structure in baked goods. Wheat flour contains proteins that interact with each other when mixed with water, forming gluten. It is this elastic gluten framework which stretches to contain the expanding leavening gases during rising. The protein content of a flour affects the strength of a dough.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During baking, the egg proteins coagulate (go from liquid state to solid state) giving the batter or dough elasticity and structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As the name suggests, all-purpose flour is suitable for all types of baked goods such as bread, biscuits, pizza, cookies, muffins, etc. It is also used in thickening gravies and sauces. Due to bran removal and loss of nutrients, all purpose flour is usually enriched with vitamins and minerals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The two proteins of importance are gliadin and glutenin. Glutenin is responsible for the elasticity of the dough while gliadin is responsible for dough extensibility. This makes gluten elastic and plastic, allowing it to expand when gas is formed during fermentation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When flour made from grinding these grains is mixed with water the two proteins combine and form gluten. Without water, gluten is not formed. The more the dough is mixed, the more gluten is developed. This causes the dough to become elastic and stretchy, as can be seen in bread dough.
