<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The organic compounds that have many structural purposes and are used in many processes within the cell are called-Proteins. The four types of most important organic molecules to structure and function are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for many organisms including humans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins are organic compounds made up of amino acids. They form muscles, speed up chemical reactions, and perform many other cellular functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of carbon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Proteins make up much of the structure of cells. Lipids are energy-rich organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids contain more energy than carbohydrates. Cells store energy in lipids for later use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cellulose molecules provide tensile strength to the primary cell wall.
