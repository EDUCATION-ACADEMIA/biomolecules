<meta name="description" content="Glucose can be found in fruits and vegetables as well as in table sugar and foods made from grains. Glucose is the base unit for large polysaccharides such as starch that are made by plants. Fructose is a monosaccharide found in fruits and honey.Glucose monosaccharides (not as part of starch) are also found naturally in some foods. The most concentrated whole food source of glucose monosaccharides is honey, followed by dried fruits such as dates, apricots, raisins, currants, cranberries, prunes and figs.Sucrose, glucose, and fructose are three types of sugar that contain the same number of calories gram for gram. Theyre all found naturally in fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and grains but are also added to many processed foods.It is a common misconception that fruits only contain fructose and that sucrose is mainly added to foods during manufacturing. In fact, almost all fruits and vegetables naturally contain sucrose, as well as glucose and fructose, in varying amounts.Fruit contains two types of sugar: fructose and glucose. The proportions of each vary, but most fruits are about half glucose and half fructose. Glucose raises blood sugar, so the body must use insulin to metabolize it.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Glucose can be found in fruits and vegetables as well as in table sugar and foods made from grains. Glucose is the base unit for large polysaccharides such as starch that are made by plants. Fructose is a monosaccharide found in fruits and honey.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Glucose monosaccharides (not as part of starch) are also found naturally in some foods. The most concentrated whole food source of glucose monosaccharides is honey, followed by dried fruits such as dates, apricots, raisins, currants, cranberries, prunes and figs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sucrose, glucose, and fructose are three types of sugar that contain the same number of calories gram for gram. Theyâ€™re all found naturally in fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and grains but are also added to many processed foods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is a common misconception that fruits only contain fructose and that sucrose is mainly added to foods during manufacturing. In fact, almost all fruits and vegetables naturally contain sucrose, as well as glucose and fructose, in varying amounts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fruit contains two types of sugar: fructose and glucose. The proportions of each vary, but most fruits are about half glucose and half fructose. Glucose raises blood sugar, so the body must use insulin to metabolize it.
