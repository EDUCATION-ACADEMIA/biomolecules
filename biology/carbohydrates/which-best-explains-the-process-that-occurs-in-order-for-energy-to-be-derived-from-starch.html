<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The process that coverts pyruvate into glucose is called gluconeogenesis . Another way organisms derive glucose is from energy stores like glycogen and starch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Glucose is converted into starch by the process called polymerization. In polymerization, several simple and soluble molecules of glucose are put together to form a complex, insoluble molecule of starch. Polymerization is similar to constructing a large building out of the same type of small blocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat. Oxygen and glucose are both reactants of cellular respiration. When one molecule of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of 36 or 38 molecules of ATP.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Thus it is converted into starch so that it cannot escape from the cells. Also cells can not use starch directly making it more stable compound for storage. Later the stored starch is converted into glucose by the cells to release energy by respiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cellular respiration is the process by which the energy in food is converted into energy that can be used by the bodyâ€™s cells. The energy stored in glucose is transferred to ATP.
