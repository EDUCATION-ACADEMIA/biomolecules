<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When a carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis (e.g., sucrose being broken down into glucose and fructose), this is recognized as saccharification. Hydrolysis reactions can be the reverse of a condensation reaction in which two molecules join into a larger one and eject a water molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When we eat carbohydrates, our body has to digest them for energy. The process of digestion is called hydrolysis. In hydrolysis, these long sugar chains (polymers) are broken down into the individual sugars (monomers) that make them up. The general formula for hydrolysis is: Polymer + Water ⇌ Monomer + Monomer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrolysis is part of the larger class of chemical reactions called nucleophilic displacement reactions in which a nucleophile (electron-rich species with an unshared pair of electrons) attacks an electrophile (electron-deficient), cleaving one covalent bond to form a new one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Chemical digestion, through a process called hydrolysis, uses water and digestive enzymes to break down the complex molecules. Digestive enzymes speed up the hydrolysis process, which is otherwise very slow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The general type of reaction that occurs during the digestion of carbohydrates is called hydrolysis. During a hydrolysis reaction, water is added across a bond in order to break a macromolecule into monomers.
