<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fructose is a type of sugar known as a monosaccharide. Like other sugars, fructose provides four calories per gram. Fructose is also known as “fruit sugar” because it primarily occurs naturally in many fruits. It also occurs naturally in other plant foods such as honey, sugar beets, sugar cane and vegetables.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fructose, or “fruit sugar, ” is a monosaccharide like glucose ( 1 ). It’s naturally found in fruit, honey, agave, and most root vegetables. Moreover, it’s commonly added to processed foods in the form of high fructose corn syrup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fructose, or “fruit sugar”, is one of the three most common natural monosaccharides. (The other two are glucose and galactose.) As its name implies, fructose is found in almost all fruits; but it also exists in commercial quantities in sugarcane, sugarbeets, and corn.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-simple carbohydrates (or simple sugars): including fructose, glucose, and lactose, which also are found in nutritious whole fruits. complex carbohydrates (or starches): found in foods such as starchy vegetables, whole grains, rice, and breads and cereals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fructose: Sometimes called “fruit sugar, ” fructose is found primarily in fruits, but also naturally occurs in vegetables, honey, sugar beets and sugar cane. Fructose is also commercially produced from corn starch for use as a caloric sweetener that is added to foods and beverages in the form of crystalline fructose.
