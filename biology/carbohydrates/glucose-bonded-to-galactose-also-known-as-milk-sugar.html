<title>Glucose bonded to galactose; also known as milk sugar.
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Galactose (/ɡəˈlæktoʊs/, galacto-+-ose, milk sugar), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 65% as sweet as sucrose. It is an aldohexose and a C-4 epimer of glucose. A galactose molecule linked with a glucose molecule forms a lactose molecule.Lactose, often called milk sugar (Latin, lac, milk), is a disaccharide found in the milk of many mammals, including humans and cows.The bond formed between glucose and galactose monosaccharides to produce the disaccharide lactose is a β-1, 4-glycosidic bond. This bond is formed between C1 of galactose and C4 of glucose, and it happens as a reduction process.The major dietary source of galactose is lactose, a disaccharide formed from one molecule of glucose plus one of galactose. Lactose is found only in milk; after weaning, significant quantities of dietary lactose are found only in dairy products (Table 1).Milk sugar is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose is less suitable as an energy source than glucose. Thus, it has been a puzzle as to why mammals utilize galactose as a major component of milk sugar.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Galactose (/ɡəˈlæktoʊs/, galacto-+-ose, “milk sugar"), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 65% as sweet as sucrose. It is an aldohexose and a C-4 epimer of glucose. A galactose molecule linked with a glucose molecule forms a lactose molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Lactose, often called milk sugar (Latin, lac, milk), is a disaccharide found in the milk of many mammals, including humans and cows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The bond formed between glucose and galactose monosaccharides to produce the disaccharide lactose is a -1, 4-glycosidic bond. This bond is formed between C1 of galactose and C4 of glucose, and it happens as a reduction process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The major dietary source of galactose is lactose, a disaccharide formed from one molecule of glucose plus one of galactose. Lactose is found only in milk; after weaning, significant quantities of dietary lactose are found only in dairy products (Table 1).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Milk sugar is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose is less suitable as an energy source than glucose. Thus, it has been a puzzle as to why mammals utilize galactose as a major component of milk sugar.
