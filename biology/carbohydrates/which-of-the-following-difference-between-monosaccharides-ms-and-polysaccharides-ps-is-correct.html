<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-According to the definitions we just went over, a monosaccharide would be a single sugar of the smallest unit, for example, glucose or fructose, while a polysaccharide would be a molecule that consists of multiple monosaccharides joined together such as the sucrose or maltose that we saw in our example.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The main difference between Monosaccharides Disaccharides and Polysaccharides is that monosaccharides are monomers of sugars and disaccharides are composed of two monomers whereas polysaccharides are composed of a large number of monomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A monosaccharide is a single sugar molecule. This includes glucose, fructose, and galactose. Disaccharides are double sugars, such as sucrose (table sugar). Polysaccharides are long chains, such as plant and animal starches.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Carbohydrates are divided into three categories: Monosaccharide– Monosaccharide includes glucose and galactose. Disaccharide-Disaccharide includes sucrose and maltose. Polysaccharide-Polysaccharide includes starch, glycogen, and cellulose.
