<title>It is referred to as the Hexose monophosphate shunt
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The hexose monophosphate shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is a unique pathway used to create products essential in the body for many reasons. The HMP shunt is an alternative pathway to glycolysis and is used to produce ribose-5-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).This pathway is also called the oxidative pentose pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt. It has been called the latter because it involves some reactions of the glycolytic pathway and therefore has been viewed as a shunt of glycolysis. It exists in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.The pentose phosphate pathway (also called the phosphogluconate pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt and the HMP Shunt) is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides.Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is variously called as Warburg-Dickens pathway and hexose monophosphate shunt. This metabolic pathway had been discovered through a number of experiments of Lippman, Warburg (1935) and Dickens (1938).The first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway is the enzymatic dehydrogenation of glucose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to give 6-phosphoglucono-Î´-lactone which is hydrolyzed to the free acid 6-phosphogluconate. Hence this pathway is also called Phosphogluconate pathway.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The hexose monophosphate shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is a unique pathway used to create products essential in the body for many reasons. The HMP shunt is an alternative pathway to glycolysis and is used to produce ribose-5-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This pathway is also called the oxidative pentose pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt. It has been called the latter because it involves some reactions of the glycolytic pathway and therefore has been viewed as a shunt of glycolysis. It exists in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The pentose phosphate pathway (also called the phosphogluconate pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt and the HMP Shunt) is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is variously called as Warburg-Dickens pathway and hexose monophosphate shunt. This metabolic pathway had been discovered through a number of experiments of Lippman, Warburg (1935) and Dickens (1938).
