<title>Why would a distance runner consume carbohydrates instead of proteins before a race?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Most high endurance athletes use carbohydrate loading as a nutrition regimen a few days prior to the event; because carbohydrate loading is known to produce an increase in stored muscle glycogen; which is known to prolong exercise, along with improve long-term performance.Carbs fuel the body with glycogen. This fuel is then stored in your muscles, which helps them perform. Not having enough carbs or cutting carbs out of your diet completely will make you feel fatigued and sluggish.Carbohydrates are the bodys main source of energy for athletic events. Carbohydrate feedings before exercise can help to restore glycogen stores, which may be called upon during prolonged training and in high-intensity competition. Carbohydrate meals should be low fat, easily digested, and tolerated by the athlete.Consuming carbohydrates during exercise lasting longer than 60 minutes ensures that the muscles receive adequate amounts of energy, especially during the later stages of the competition or workout. This has also been found to improve performance.">

<strong> Why would a distance runner consume carbohydrates instead of proteins before a race? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Carbohydrates provide insulation for heat. 
</p>
<p>(B) Carbohydrates provide structure for tissues. 
</p>
<p>(C) Carbohydrates provide genetic material for muscle cells. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Carbohydrates provide energy for endurance.
