<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-There is one major difference between Starch and Cellulose. For starch, glucose repeat units are located in the same direction, and each successive glucose unit is rotated 180 degrees in cellulose. Cellulose is thicker than sugar, which is water-insoluble.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Starch and glycogen are made up of -glucose subunits, whereas cellulose is made up of -glucose subunits. Cellulose is unbranched and a straight-chain polymer of glucose, whereas starch and glycogen are branched.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Structure of Starch and Cellulose Starch and cellulose are both homopolymers of glucose, meaning they are only made of repeating units of glucose molecules. However, their structure is different based on how the glucose molecules are connected. Starch is made of two types of glucose polymers: amylose and amylopectin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There is only one difference. In starch, all the glucose repeat units are oriented in the same direction. But in cellulose, each succesive glucose unit is rotated 180 degrees around the axis of the polymer backbone chain, relative to the last repeat unit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The main difference is the anomeric configureration: amylose’s glucose units are linked with glycosidic bonds, whereas cellulose’s monomeric units are linked by glycosidic bonds. This different kind of bonding causes amylose to form helical structures and cellulose to form straight polymer chains.
