<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Most large biological molecules are polymers, long chains made up of repeating molecular subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. If you think of a monomer as being like a bead, then you can think of a polymer as being like a necklace, a series of beads strung together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Polymers are large molecules made up of long chains or networks of smaller molecules called monomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Biomacromolecules are large biological polymers, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, that are made up of monomers linked together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Monomers are atoms or small molecules that bond together to form more complex structures such as polymers. There are four main types of monomer, including sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleotides.
