<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Dehydration Synthesis The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis is the creation of larger molecules from smaller monomers where a water molecule is released. This can be used in the creation of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the creation of large biological molecules such as carbohydrate polymers and triglycerides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In the dehydration synthesis reaction above, two molecules of the sugar glucose (monomers) combine to form a single molecule of the sugar maltose. One of the glucose molecules loses an H, the other loses an OH group, and a water molecule is released as a new covalent bond forms between the two glucose molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Making and breaking polymers Joining two monomers is achieved by a process known as dehydration synthesis. One monomer gives up a hydroxyl (OH) group and one gives up a (H). These combine to make a water molecule.
