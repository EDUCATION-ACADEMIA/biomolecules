<title>Sugars and starches are examples of which organic molecules?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Carbohydrates are the most common type of organic compound. A carbohydrate is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is used to store energy.Carbohydrates are split into 2 different types, Sugars and Starch. Starchy carbohydrates include foods such as bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and breakfast cereals, whilst sugars include those that naturally occur in fruit and milk but also added sugars used in cakes and biscuits as well as table sugar.Answer and Explanation: Sugars and starches in the body are referred to as carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are classified by the size of the molecules and can be monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.All carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or are compounds that can be broken down to form such compounds. Examples of carbohydrates include starch, fiber, the sweet-tasting compounds called sugars, and structural materials such as cellulose.Sucrose, also known as cane sugar or saccharose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Carbohydrates are the most common type of organic compound. A carbohydrate is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is used to store energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Carbohydrates are split into 2 different types, Sugars and Starch. Starchy carbohydrates include foods such as bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and breakfast cereals, whilst sugars include those that naturally occur in fruit and milk but also added sugars used in cakes and biscuits as well as table sugar.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Sugars and starches in the body are referred to as carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are classified by the size of the molecules and can be monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All carbohydrates consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or are compounds that can be broken down to form such compounds. Examples of carbohydrates include starch, fiber, the sweet-tasting compounds called sugars, and structural materials such as cellulose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Sucrose, also known as cane sugar or saccharose, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as o-glycosyl compounds. These are glycoside in which a sugar group is bonded through one carbon to another group via a O-glycosidic bond.
