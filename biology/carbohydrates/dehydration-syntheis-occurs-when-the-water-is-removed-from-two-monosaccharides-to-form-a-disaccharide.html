<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Monosaccharides are bonded with each other through glycosidic linkage. This linkage is formed by the reaction of –OH groups of two monomer units with the elimination of water molecules. Formation of maltose is an example of a dehydration synthesis reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Disaccharides (di-= “two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The monosaccharide glucose can be used as a building block for more complex sugars and carbohydrates. Two glucose molecules can be linked together through a dehydration synthesis reaction to form a disaccharide called maltose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-These bonds form via a dehydration reaction, also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis. In this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water. ” It is also considered to be a condensation reaction since two molecules are condensed into one larger molecule with the loss of a smaller molecule (the water.)
