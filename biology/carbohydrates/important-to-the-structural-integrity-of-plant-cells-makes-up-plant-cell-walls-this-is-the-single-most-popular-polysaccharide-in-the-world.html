<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cellulose is the most essential structural component of plant cell walls and the most common macromolecule and organic substance on the Earth. Cellulose is made up of carbohydrates which is a polysaccharide structure. Polysaccharide is made up of long chains of many sugar molecules that are chemically linked together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide produced in nature and generally serves as the major scaffolding component for plant cell wall architecture.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cellulose molecules are arranged parallel to each other and are joined together with hydrogen bonds. This forms long, cable-like structures, which combine with other cellulose molecules and is what produces such a strong support structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The high tensile strength of cellulose fibers present in the plant cell wall is responsible for maintaining the shape and rigidity of plant cells. It is due to such strong cellulose fibers in the cell wall that plant cells do not burst like animal cells when placed in a hypotonic solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The most important part of a plant cell is the nucleus. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA. It is usually the largest organelle which is found in a plant cell.
