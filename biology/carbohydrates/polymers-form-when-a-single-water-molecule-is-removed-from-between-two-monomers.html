<title>Polymers form when a single water molecule is removed from between two monomers
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means to put together while losing water. Figure 3.1.In the dehydration synthesis reaction above, two molecules of the sugar glucose (monomers) combine to form a single molecule of the sugar maltose. One of the glucose molecules loses an H, the other loses an OH group, and a water molecule is released as a new covalent bond forms between the two glucose molecules.Dehydration synthesis is the creation of larger molecules from smaller monomers where a water molecule is released. This can be used in the creation of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the creation of large biological molecules such as carbohydrate polymers and triglycerides.Dehydration means the removal of the water molecules. Two monomer molecules undergo a dehydration reaction, which is a type of condensation reaction, to form polymer molecules with the removal of the water molecule as a by-product.Dehydration reactions can be defined as the chemical reactions in which a water molecule is eliminated from the reactant molecule. The process of combination of two molecules with the elimination of water molecules is called dehydration synthesis.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.” Figure 3.1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the dehydration synthesis reaction above, two molecules of the sugar glucose (monomers) combine to form a single molecule of the sugar maltose. One of the glucose molecules loses an H, the other loses an OH group, and a water molecule is released as a new covalent bond forms between the two glucose molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis is the creation of larger molecules from smaller monomers where a water molecule is released. This can be used in the creation of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the creation of large biological molecules such as carbohydrate polymers and triglycerides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Dehydration means the removal of the water molecules. Two monomer molecules undergo a dehydration reaction, which is a type of condensation reaction, to form polymer molecules with the removal of the water molecule as a by-product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-“Dehydration reactions can be defined as the chemical reactions in which a water molecule is eliminated from the reactant molecule. The process of combination of two molecules with the elimination of water molecules is called dehydration synthesis.”
