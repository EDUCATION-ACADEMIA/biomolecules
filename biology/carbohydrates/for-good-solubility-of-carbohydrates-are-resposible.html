<title>For good solubility of carbohydrates are resposible:

<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: Various hydroxyl groups are found in the structures of carbohydrates. The nature of hydroxyl groups is polar and thus, they readily dissolve in polar solvent that is water. These groups are responsible for the solubility of carbohydrates in water.Carbohydrates are hydrophilic substances which are soluble in water and alcohol. The-OH groups of carbohydrates are primarily responsible for their solubility.Because carbohydrates have many hydroxyl groups associated with the molecule, they are therefore excellent H-bond donors and acceptors.The term carbohydrates (or sugars) refers to a group of polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones. This means that a carbohydrate molecule contains several hydroxyl groups and either an aldehyde or a ketone group (see below).The hydroxyl group that is attached to the anomeric carbon atom (i.e., the carbon containing the aldehyde or keto group) of carbohydrates in solution has unusual reactivity, and derivatives, called glycosides, can be formed; glycosides formed from glucose are called glucosides.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Various hydroxyl groups are found in the structures of carbohydrates. The nature of hydroxyl groups is polar and thus, they readily dissolve in polar solvent that is water. These groups are responsible for the solubility of carbohydrates in water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Carbohydrates are hydrophilic substances which are soluble in water and alcohol. The-OH groups of carbohydrates are primarily responsible for their solubility.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Because carbohydrates have many hydroxyl groups associated with the molecule, they are therefore excellent H-bond donors and acceptors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The term carbohydrates (or sugars) refers to a group of polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones. This means that a carbohydrate molecule contains several hydroxyl groups and either an aldehyde or a ketone group (see below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The hydroxyl group that is attached to the anomeric carbon atom (i.e., the carbon containing the aldehyde or keto group) of carbohydrates in solution has unusual reactivity, and derivatives, called glycosides, can be formed; glycosides formed from glucose are called glucosides.
