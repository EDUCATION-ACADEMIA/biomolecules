<meta name="description" content="Point out to students that quick breads are made with leavening agents that allow immediate baking. Yeast breads, on the other hand, are leavened with yeast and must be kneaded and allowed to rise before baking.Yeast is a living cell that multiplies rapidly when given the proper food, moisture, and warmth. It must proof, or rise, to allow the production of carbon dioxide that allows the bread to rise during baking. Quick breads use the chemical leavening agents of baking powder and/or baking soda.Yeast is the most widely used biological leavening agent. What is this? As yeast grows, it converts sugar food into alcohol and carbon dioxide through fermentation.Generally speaking, yeast breads have a lower fat and sugar content than quick breads. Yeast breads take a bit more work than quick breads.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Point out to students that quick breads are made with leavening agents that allow immediate baking. Yeast breads, on the other hand, are leavened with yeast and must be kneaded and allowed to rise before baking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Yeast is a living cell that multiplies rapidly when given the proper food, moisture, and warmth. It must “proof”, or rise, to allow the production of carbon dioxide that allows the bread to rise during baking. Quick breads use the chemical leavening agents of baking powder and/or baking soda.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Yeast is the most widely used biological leavening agent. What is this? As yeast grows, it converts sugar food into alcohol and carbon dioxide through fermentation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Generally speaking, yeast breads have a lower fat and sugar content than quick breads. Yeast breads take a bit more work than quick breads. This type of bread dough requires kneading (though if you have stand mixer with a dough hook, that part’s a snap).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Simply put, quick bread is a bread recipe that is made without yeast. That’s it! Instead of using yeast to achieve a rise, these bread recipes rely upon leavening agents like baking soda and baking powder. Unlike yeasted breads, quick breads don’t need to be proofed or kneaded.
