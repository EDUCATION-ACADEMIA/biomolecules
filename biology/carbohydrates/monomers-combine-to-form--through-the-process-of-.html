<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the dehydration synthesis reaction above, two molecules of the sugar glucose (monomers) combine to form a single molecule of the sugar maltose. One of the glucose molecules loses an H, the other loses an OH group, and a water molecule is released as a new covalent bond forms between the two glucose molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Polymerization is the process to create polymers. These polymers are then processed to make various kinds of plastic products. During polymerization, smaller molecules, called monomers or building blocks, are chemically combined to create larger molecules or a macromolecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis is the creation of larger molecules from smaller monomers where a water molecule is released. This can be used in the creation of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the creation of large biological molecules such as carbohydrate polymers and triglycerides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-hydrolysis converts a polymer to it’s monomers, because it is two molecules releasing a drop of water. dehydration synthesis converts monomers to a polymer and gains a drop of water. a hydroxyl (-OH) group is removed from one monomer and a hydrogen (-H) from another, producing water as a by-product.
