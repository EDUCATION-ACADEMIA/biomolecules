<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As additional monomers join via multiple dehydration synthesis reactions, this chain of repeating monomers begins to form a polymer. Complex carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins are all examples of polymers that are formed by dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-’ Monomers can join together to make polymers, and polymers can break apart into monomers. There are unique reactions that occur in our bodies to do this. Dehydration reactions are those that link monomers together to form polymers, and hydrolysis breaks polymers apart into monomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-PET is formed by dehydration synthesis from two monomers – ethylene glycol and teraphthalic acid. In biological systems, dehydration synthesis reactions occur in every cell, especially since it is important for the formation of ATP. Nearly all biopolymers are also derived from this reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Dehydration reactions allow solutions to evaporate; hydrolysis reactions dissolve solutes. Dehydration reactions and hydrolysis reactions assemble polymers from monomers. Hydrolysis reactions create polymers from monomers; and dehydration reactions create monomers from polymers.
