<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: hydrogenated oils are often used by food companies to be able to extend the shelf life of the products, this means to extend the expiring date on their products and it is done by adding hydrogen to a insaturated fat, this creates a type of fat called trans fat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Trans fat is made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil. These oils are called partially hydrogenated. Any food made with partially hydrogenated oil contains trans fat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrogenated oils are oils that have had hydrogen added to them to make them less likely to spoil. The difference between partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated fats is that the partial hydrogenation creates trans-fats, while fully hydrogenated, the oil returns to a “zero trans-fat” level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sources in the modern diet Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are the largest source of trans fats in your diet because they’re cheap to manufacture and have a long shelf life.
