<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Lactose is the major disaccharide found in milk, and is catabolized into glucose and galactose by the enzyme lactase. Lactose is an important energy source and ssometimes it is referred to simply as milk sugar, as it is present in high percentages in dairy products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Lactose, often called milk sugar (Latin, lac, milk), is a disaccharide found in the milk of many mammals, including humans and cows. The IUPAC name of lactose is 4-O-(-d-galactopyranosyl)-d-glucopyranose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-For example, milk sugar (lactose) is a disaccharide made by condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, whereas the disaccharide sucrose in sugar cane and sugar beet, is a condensation product of glucose and fructose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Lactose is a disaccharide, which means it is made up of two sugar molecules, or monosaccharides. This molecule is the main sugar present in milk and dairy products (cheese, yogurt, butter, etc.). It is found in the milk of all placental mammals, including humans.
