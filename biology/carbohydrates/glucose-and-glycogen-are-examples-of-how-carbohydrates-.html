<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Glucose (sugar) is your body’s main source of energy. It comes from carbohydrates (a macronutrient) in certain foods and fluids you consume. When your body doesn’t immediately need glucose from the food you eat for energy, it stores glucose primarily in your muscles and liver as glycogen for later use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Carbohydrate can be stored as glycogen mainly in skeletal muscles or the liver; fat is manly stores as triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. With filled glycogen stores, glucose can be the substrate for de novo lipid synthesis and stored in adipocytes, muscles, or the liver and cause insulin resistance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Glucose is the main source of fuel for our cells. When the body doesn’t need to use the glucose for energy, it stores it in the liver and muscles. This stored form of glucose is made up of many connected glucose molecules and is called glycogen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When you eat carbs, your body breaks them down into simple sugars, which are absorbed into the bloodstream. As the sugar level rises in your body, the pancreas releases a hormone called insulin. Insulin is needed to move sugar from the blood into the cells, where the sugar can be used as a source of energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Glycogen is the stored form of a simple sugar called glucose. Your body gets glucose from the food you eat (mostly from carbohydrates) and uses it as fuel for your cells. If you have extra glucose in your blood, your body stores it as glycogen for later use.
