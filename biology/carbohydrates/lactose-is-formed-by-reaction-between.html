<meta name="description" content="Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose.Lactose is composed of a molecule of galactose joined to a molecule of glucose by a β-1, 4-glycosidic linkage. It is a reducing sugar that is found in milk. Sucrose is composed of a molecule of glucose joined to a molecule of fructose by an α-1, β-2-glycosidic linkage.Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is (e) dehydration reaction. A dehydration reaction occurs when two molecules are bound together in a process that releases a water molecule.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a -1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is -D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Lactose is composed of a molecule of galactose joined to a molecule of glucose by a -1, 4-glycosidic linkage. It is a reducing sugar that is found in milk. Sucrose is composed of a molecule of glucose joined to a molecule of fructose by an -1, -2-glycosidic linkage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is (e) dehydration reaction. A dehydration reaction occurs when two molecules are bound together in a process that releases a water molecule. In this case, galactose and glucose are both monosaccharides that are combined into the disaccharide lactose by a dehydration reaction.

Global demand for lactose has grown appreciably over the last 10 years, the lactose industry having adapted accordingly, especially in the USA and Europe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Galactose reacts with glucose to make the disaccharide lactose. However, glucose and galactose cannot be easily converted into one another. Galactose cannot play the same part in respiration as glucose.
