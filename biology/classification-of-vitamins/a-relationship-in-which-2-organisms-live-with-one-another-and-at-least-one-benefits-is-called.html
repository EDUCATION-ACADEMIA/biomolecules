<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Symbiosis is a term describing any relationship or interaction between two dissimilar organisms. The specific kind of symbiosis depends on whether either or both organisms benefit from the relationship.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Symbiosis is defined as a close, prolonged association between two or more different biological species. This relationship can be symbiotic (mutualistic), where both parties involved benefit from the interaction, or it can be parasitic, where one party benefits while the other is harmed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where all species involved benefit from their interactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Symbiosis refers to a close and prolonged association between two organisms of different species. Mutualism refers to mutually beneficial interactions between members of the same or different species. Mutualistic interactions need not necessarily be symbiotic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Commensalism is a relationship in which one organism benefits and the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. Mutualism is a relationship in which both organisms benefit.
