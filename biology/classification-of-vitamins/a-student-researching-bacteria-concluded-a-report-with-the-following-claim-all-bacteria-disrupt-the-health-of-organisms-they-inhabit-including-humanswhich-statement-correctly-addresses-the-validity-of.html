<strong> A student researching bacteria concluded a report with the following claim:‚Äù All bacteria disrupt the health of organisms they inhabit, including humans."Which statement correctly addresses the validity of the claim? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The claim is valid because many studies and experiments have shown that bacteria disrupt homeostasis. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The claim is invalid because there are many types of bacteria that help organisms maintain homeostasis. 
</p>
<p>(C) The claim is invalid because only microorganisms such as viruses disrupt the health of organisms. 
</p>
<p>(D) The claim is valid because bacteria cause disease.
