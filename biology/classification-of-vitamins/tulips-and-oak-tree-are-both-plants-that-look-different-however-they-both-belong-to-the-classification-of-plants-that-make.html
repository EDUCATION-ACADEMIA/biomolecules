<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Conifers are seed plants; they include pines, firs, yew, redwood, and many other large trees. The other major group of seed-plants are the flowering plants, including plants whose flowers are showy, but also many plants with reduced flowers, such as the oaks, grasses, and palms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The seed plants are often divided arbitrarily into two groups: the gymnosperms and the angiosperms. The basis for this distinction is that angiosperms produce flowers, while the gymnosperms do not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-There are two main groups of seed plants: Gymnosperms – plants with cones. Angiosperms – plants with flowers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, have seeds that are enclosed within an ovary (usually a fruit), while gymnosperms have no flowers or fruits, and have unenclosed or “naked” seeds on the surface of scales or leaves. Gymnosperm seeds are often configured as cones.
