<meta name="description" content="Enzymic browning is an oxidation reaction that takes place in some foods, mostly fruit and vegetables, causing the food to turn brown. Oxidation reactions occur in food and non-food items. Enzymic browning is a reaction which requires the action of enzymes and oxidation in order to occur.Trapped inside the tissue of fruits are molecules known as enzymes. These enzymes help fruit ripen and turn brown. When fruit is cut or starts to break down, the enzyme is released from the tissue of the fruit and exposed to air which causes the fruit to rapidly change color. This is known as enzymatic browning.Detailed Solution The enzyme polyphenol oxidase (also known as tyrosinase) located in the cells gets exposed to and reacts with oxygen in the air when fresh fruits and vegetables are peeled or cut open. The browning of fruits and vegetables is caused by a chemical reaction known as oxidation.Consequently, enzymatic browning development may be responsible for more than 50% of foods susceptible to browning are wasted [6]. An enzymatic browning reaction is mainly caused by enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) (EC 1.10.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymic browning is an oxidation reaction that takes place in some foods, mostly fruit and vegetables, causing the food to turn brown. Oxidation reactions occur in food and non-food items. Enzymic browning is a reaction which requires the action of enzymes and oxidation in order to occur.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Trapped inside the tissue of fruits are molecules known as enzymes. These enzymes help fruit ripen and turn brown. When fruit is cut or starts to break down, the enzyme is released from the tissue of the fruit and exposed to air which causes the fruit to rapidly change color. This is known as enzymatic browning.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Detailed Solution The enzyme polyphenol oxidase (also known as tyrosinase) located in the cells gets exposed to and reacts with oxygen in the air when fresh fruits and vegetables are peeled or cut open. The browning of fruits and vegetables is caused by a chemical reaction known as oxidation.
