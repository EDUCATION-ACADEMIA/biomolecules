<title>Which of the following occurs after a virus attaches to a host cell in the viral reproduction process?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cells genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.The viruss genome is uncoated from the protein and injected into the host cell. Then the viral genome hijacks the host cells machinery, forcing it to replicate the viral genome and produce viral proteins to make new capsids. Next, the viral particles are assembled into new viruses.Once attached to the surface, viruses can gain entry to the cell via the changes that occur after binding. Binding a specific receptor can lead to conformational changes in the proteins on the viral capsid that lead to the viral and cellular membranes fusing.Step 1: Attachment: The virus attaches itself to the target cell. Step 2: Penetration: The virus is brought into the target cell. Step 3: Uncoating and Replication: The enveloped virus loses its envelope, and viral RNA is released into the nucleus, where it is replicated. Step 4: Assembly: Viral proteins are assembled.">

<strong> Which of the following occurs after a virus attaches to a host cell in the viral reproduction process? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The host cell dies 
</p>
<p>(B) The virus dies 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The virus inserts its genetic information into the host cell 
</p>
<p>(D) copies of the virus are immediately released from the host 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cell’s genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The virus’s genome is uncoated from the protein and injected into the host cell. Then the viral genome hijacks the host cell’s machinery, forcing it to replicate the viral genome and produce viral proteins to make new capsids. Next, the viral particles are assembled into new viruses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Once attached to the surface, viruses can gain entry to the cell via the changes that occur after binding. Binding a specific receptor can lead to conformational changes in the proteins on the viral capsid that lead to the viral and cellular membranes fusing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Step 1: Attachment: The virus attaches itself to the target cell. Step 2: Penetration: The virus is brought into the target cell. Step 3: Uncoating and Replication: The enveloped virus loses its envelope, and viral RNA is released into the nucleus, where it is replicated. Step 4: Assembly: Viral proteins are assembled.
