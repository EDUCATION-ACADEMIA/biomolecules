<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Prokaryotes generally have cell walls and some organelles such as ribosomes. However, their unique feature is that they do not have. Since they do not have membrane-bound organelles, they also do not have nuclei. Prokaryotes still contain DNA that consists of nucleic acids, but they float freely in their cytoplasm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack a nucleus and other organelles. Prokaryotes are divided into two distinct groups: the bacteria and the archaea, which scientists believe have unique evolutionary lineages. Most prokaryotes are small, single-celled organisms that have a relatively simple structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Do prokaryotes have a nucleus? Prokaryotes do not have a nucleus. Instead prokaryote DNA can be found, bundled but free-floating, in a central region called the nucleoid. Prokaryote DNA is usually found as a single chromosome of circular DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The most straight-forward answer would be that they do not need one. This article suggests that the evolution of the nuclear membrane allowed the separation of the processes of translation from transcription. This allowed greater control of these two key cell functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is where cells store their DNA, which is the genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus.
