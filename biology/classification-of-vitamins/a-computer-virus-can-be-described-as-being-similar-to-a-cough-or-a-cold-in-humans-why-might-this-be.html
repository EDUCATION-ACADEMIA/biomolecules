<strong> A computer virus can be described as being similar to a cough or a cold in humans. Why might this be? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Viruses make both humans and computers feel bad 
</p>
<p>(B) Viruses damage computers 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Computer viruses can copy themselves and spread

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Think of it like the common cold, often a computer virus can simply slow down your device, whereas like the flu, things can become more serious and your device may stop operating altogether. Much like the common cold or the flu virus, a computer virus can also replicate itself and spread from one device to another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Worms are a self-replicating type of malware (and a type of virus) that enter networks by exploiting vulnerabilities, moving quickly from one computer to another. Because of this, worms can propagate themselves and spread very quickly – not only locally, but have the potential to disrupt systems worldwide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-While biological and computer viruses have similarities, there are, of course, significant differences in how they behave and how they can be tackled. It’s important to remember that humans come with a built-in, self-enhancing “antivirus, ” but most devices don’t.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A computer virus is a program designed to spread itself by first infecting files or hard drives and then making copies of itself. Viruses spread by infecting other programs, either on the same computer or on other computers connected to it over a network.
