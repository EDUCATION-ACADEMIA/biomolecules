<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Disaccharides are formed by joining pairs of various monosaccharides via -or -glycosidic bonds. A hemiacetal hydroxyl group formed from the oxygen of the carbonyl group (−C=O) always participates in the formation of these bonds. In certain cases, all the carbonyl groups in the molecule are used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Disaccharides are formed by the condensation reactions of two simple sugar molecules. Condensation is the loss of water in a chemical reaction. Two OH groups, one from each sugar molecule, come together to release water and form an oxygen bridge between.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Maltose is mainly produced by partial hydrolysis of starch and consists of two glucose units linked by an -1, 4-glycosidic bond (Figure 2(c)). Some nutritionally important disaccharides and disaccharide derivatives and their significance are outlined in Table 2.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A dissaccharide formed by 1 1-glycosidic linkage between their monosaccharide units is Trehalose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-N Glycosidic Bond An O-glycosidic bond is formed when the anomeric carbon of the sugar establishes a link with the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group of the alcohol.
