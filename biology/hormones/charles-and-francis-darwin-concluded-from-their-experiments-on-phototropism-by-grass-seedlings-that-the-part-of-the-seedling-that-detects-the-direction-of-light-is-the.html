<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-1)answer-a)Charles and francis darwin concluded from their experiment on phototropism by grass seedlings that the part of the seedling that detects the direction of light is the tip of the coleoptile that bends towards the response.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Darwin correctly concluded that plants are able to “see” light using the tips of the plant shoots, rather than through the stalks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In 1880, Charles Darwin and his son Francis published a paper in which they described the bending of grass seedlings towards light. Specifically, they examined this response in very young plants that had just sprouted whose leaves and shoots were still covered by a sheath called the coleoptile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Charles Darwin’s Experiment They observed the bending of seedlings towards sunlight. They demonstrated by covering the tips of the oat coleoptiles which prevented it from photosynthesis. Simultaneously, when they covered the lower portion of these coleoptiles, they turned phototropic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Experiments by Charles and Francis Darwin demonstrated that the tip of a plant’s shoot senses light, and that some kind of chemical signal travels from the tip to the growing region. The shoot responds to this signal by bending the toward the light.
