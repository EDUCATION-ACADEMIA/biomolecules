<meta name="description" content="Endocrine glands do not have ducts. Exocrine glands have ducts. Secretory products are released directly into the bloodstream, eventually reaching the target organ. Secretory products are released to an internal organ or the external surface through a duct.Two principal types of glands exist: exocrine and endocrine. The key difference between the two types is that, whereas exocrine glands secrete substances into a ductal system to an epithelial surface, endocrine glands secrete products directly into the bloodstream [1].1. The exocrine gland sends their secretions through ducts directly to target organs of the body. 1. Endocrine glands are the ductless glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, hormones directly into the blood.Expert-verified answer A gland is a collection of cells in the body of an animal that produce substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities within the body or on its surface (exocrine gland).The cells in these glands secrete specific chemicals called hormones. Hormones circulate around the body via the blood stream and modulate cellular or organ functions by binding with receptors in the target cells. Hormones that stimulate and control the activity of other endocrine glands are called trophic hormones.">

<strong> what is the main difference between endocrine and exocrine glands? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The exocrine glands release chemical substances directly into the blood stream &amp; the endocrine glands release chemical substances through ducts to the Inside of the body . 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The Endocrine glands release chemical substances directly into the blood steam &amp; the exocrine glands release chemical substances through ducts to the outside of the body .

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Endocrine glands do not have ducts. Exocrine glands have ducts. Secretory products are released directly into the bloodstream, eventually reaching the target organ. Secretory products are released to an internal organ or the external surface through a duct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Two principal types of glands exist: exocrine and endocrine. The key difference between the two types is that, whereas exocrine glands secrete substances into a ductal system to an epithelial surface, endocrine glands secrete products directly into the bloodstream [1].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-1. The exocrine gland sends their secretions through ducts directly to target organs of the body. 1. Endocrine glands are the ductless glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, hormones directly into the blood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Expert-verified answer A gland is a collection of cells in the body of an animal that produce substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities within the body or on its surface (exocrine gland).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cells in these glands secrete specific chemicals called hormones. Hormones circulate around the body via the blood stream and modulate cellular or organ functions by binding with receptors in the target cells. Hormones that stimulate and control the activity of other endocrine glands are called trophic hormones.
