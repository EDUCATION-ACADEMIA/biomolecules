Gravity can be either artificial gravity or natural gravity.

This response to gravity is called Geotropism. Geotropism causes roots to grow downward, and stems and leaves to grow up.Geotropism (also called gravitropism) is the directional growth of an organism in response to gravity.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gravitropism (also known as geotropism) is a coordinated process of differential growth by a plant in response to gravity pulling on it. It also occurs in fungi. Gravity can be either “artificial gravity” or natural gravity. It is a general feature of all higher and many lower plants as well as other organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Gravitropism is the ability of plants to perceive and respond to the gravity vector and orient themselves accordingly. The gravitropic pathway can be divided into three main components: perception, biochemical signaling, and differential growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Explain to students that plants respond to different forces; sunflowers follow the light, pea tendrils grasp whatever they touch, and plants respond to gravity. This response to gravity is called Geotropism. Geotropism causes roots to grow downward, and stems and leaves to grow up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Geotropism (also called gravitropism) is the directional growth of an organism in response to gravity. Roots display positive geotropism when they grow downward, while shoots display negative geotropism when they grow upward. Among the first scientists to study geotropism was Charles Darwin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Tropisms are growth toward or away from a stimulus. Types of tropisms include gravitropism (gravity), phototropism (light), and thigmotropism (touch). Plant roots always grow downward because specialized cells in root caps detect and respond to gravity. This is an example of a tropism.
