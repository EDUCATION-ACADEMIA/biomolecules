<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, which include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worms, viruses, and even infectious proteins called prions. Pathogens of all classes must have mechanisms for entering their host and for evading immediate destruction by the host immune system. Most bacteria are not pathogenic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A pathogen is defined as an organism causing disease to its host, with the severity of the disease symptoms referred to as virulence. Pathogens are taxonomically widely diverse and comprise viruses and bacteria as well as unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Another name for a pathogen is an infectious agent, as they cause infections. As with any organism, pathogens prioritize survival and reproduction. The human bodyâ€™s immune system acts as a defense against pathogens. The body can easily fight off some pathogens, but others are potentially fatal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Pathogenic organisms are of five main types: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and worms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Pathogenic organisms. Similar term(s): pathogen. Definition: Organisms, including bacteria, viruses or cysts, capable of causing diseases (typhoid, cholera, dysentery) in a host (such as a person). There are many types of organisms which do NOT cause disease.
