<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It was suggested that the promoting effect on cucumber fruit growth is linked to the induction of cell cycle-related genes. Interestingly, application of BR to unpollinated cucumber flowers produced seedless fruits similar to those of the pollinated flowers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-However, when plants are exposed to external ethylene from sources; e.g., truck exhaust; heaters; cigarette smoke; and ripening fruit; flowers, buds, and leaves of cut flowers can be adversely affected. Buds and flowers can turn yellow, wilt, and/or drop. Buds may fail to open and flowers die prematurely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Parthenocarpy is induced by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is produced at the tip of the stem.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Growing seedless fruits Some people prefer eating fruit without seeds. One method of making fruit grow without seeds inside is to spray the flower with hormones such as auxin or gibberellin. This is called parthenocarpic fruit development.
