<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This type of growth movement is called phototropism. The growth increases in the shoots of the sunflower that is away from sunlight, causing the plant to bend towards the sunâ€™s direction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The movement of sunflower in accordance with the path of the sun is due to phototropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Phototropism is the growth of a plant in the direction of light. It is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Thus, the movement of the sunflower towards the sun is due to phototropism. Was this answer helpful?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Heliotropism, also called phototropism, is most apparent in immature sunflower buds. As the flowers develop, they lose their flexibility of movement. A flexible segment of the stem just below the flower responds to pressure within the motor cells, causing the sunflower to turn toward light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Plants grow towards or away from the light, the type of tropism in the response to light is called phototropism. Sunflower grow in accordance to sun is an example of positive phototropism.
