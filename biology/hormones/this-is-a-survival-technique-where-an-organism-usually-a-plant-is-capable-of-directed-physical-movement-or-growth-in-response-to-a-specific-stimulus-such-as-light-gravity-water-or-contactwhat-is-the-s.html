Explanation of correct option-Thigmotropism is the directional growth movement of plants that occurs in response to the stimulus of touch. Thigmotropism is generally found in tendrils and creepers.Plant Tropisms A tropism is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the environment. Growing toward gravity is called geotropism. Plants also exhibit phototropism, or growing toward a light source. This response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called auxin.The movement of a whole plant or a part of plant, in response to the direction of stimulus is called tropism. The stimulus can be water, sunlight or gravity.The movement of plant due to touch is known as a thigmotropic movement. Thigmotropism is a directional growth movement which occurs as a mechanosensory response to a touch stimulus. For example, once a shoot touches a suitable support, it grows towards the surface it is touching.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hydrotropism is the mechanism by which plants grow toward the presence of water in response to stimuli related to water. In this case, it is a form of positive tropism, which is the response of a plant to a stimulus that leads to growth or movement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-thigmotropism. The correct option is B. Explanation of correct option-Thigmotropism is the directional growth movement of plants that occurs in response to the stimulus of touch. Thigmotropism is generally found in tendrils and creepers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plant Tropisms A tropism is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the environment. Growing toward gravity is called geotropism. Plants also exhibit phototropism, or growing toward a light source. This response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called auxin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The movement of a whole plant or a part of plant, in response to the direction of stimulus is called tropism. The stimulus can be water, sunlight or gravity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The movement of plant due to touch is known as a thigmotropic movement. Thigmotropism is a directional growth movement which occurs as a mechanosensory response to a touch stimulus. For example, once a shoot touches a suitable support, it grows towards the surface it is touching.
