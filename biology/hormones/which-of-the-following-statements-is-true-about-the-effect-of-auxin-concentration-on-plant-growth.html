<title>Which of the following statements is true about the effect of auxin concentration on plant growth?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Auxins are organic substances, which promote the growth and development of plants at low concentrations. Auxins regulate numerous developmental processes in plants including cell expansion, root initiation, vascular tissue differentiation, bud and flower growth (Davies, 2013).Correct option: a IAA and IBA are natural but NAA 2 4-D and 2 4 5-T are synthetic auxins. Explanation:Natural auxin are naturally occurring auxin plants hormone which is called photo hormones. Eg.Auxin is an important plant hormone which has direct effect on cell elongation, multiplication, phototactic movements, etc. It is found commercially helpful because of several characters like: callus formation, curvature of stem and induction of growth of root in stem cuttings.Auxin regulates plant growth. It stimulates cell elongation in stems. Auxins also play a role in cell division and differentiation, in fruit development, in the formation of roots from cuttings. Thus, the correct option is D) All of the above.">
