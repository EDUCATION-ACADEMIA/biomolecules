<title>What type of tropism is involved when stems grow away from gravity?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Gravitropism. It is a type of tropism where plants show some growth in response to gravity. Stems are negative to the gravitropism while roots are positive to the gravitropism. This is also referred to as geotropism.Plant parts can grow with or against gravity. This type of tropism is called gravitropism. Roots of a plant grow downward and exhibit positive gravitropism. Stems, on the other hand, exhibit negative gravitropism since they grow upwards and against the force of gravity (see Figure 1).The roots grown downward in the direction of gravity, which is positive gravitropism, and the shoot grows upward away from gravity, which is negative gravitropism. The reason plants know which way to grow in response to gravity is due to amyloplasts in the plants.Two very important plant processes that are ubiquitous among all plants are the two tropisms: phototropism and gravitropism.Gravitropism is the ability of plants to perceive and respond to the gravity vector and orient themselves accordingly. The gravitropic pathway can be divided into three main components: perception, biochemical signaling, and differential growth.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gravitropism. It is a type of tropism where plants show some growth in response to gravity. Stems are negative to the gravitropism while roots are positive to the gravitropism. This is also referred to as geotropism.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Plant parts can grow with or against gravity. This type of tropism is called gravitropism. Roots of a plant grow downward and exhibit positive gravitropism. Stems, on the other hand, exhibit negative gravitropism since they grow upwards and against the force of gravity (see Figure 1).

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The roots grown downward in the direction of gravity, which is positive gravitropism, and the shoot grows upward away from gravity, which is negative gravitropism. The reason plants know which way to grow in response to gravity is due to amyloplasts in the plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Two very important plant processes that are ubiquitous among all plants are the two tropisms: phototropism and gravitropism.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gravitropism is the ability of plants to perceive and respond to the gravity vector and orient themselves accordingly. The gravitropic pathway can be divided into three main components: perception, biochemical signaling, and differential growth.
