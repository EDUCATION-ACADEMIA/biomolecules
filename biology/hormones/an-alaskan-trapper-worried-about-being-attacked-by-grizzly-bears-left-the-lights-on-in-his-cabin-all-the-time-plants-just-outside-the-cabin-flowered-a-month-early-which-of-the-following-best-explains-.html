<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An Alaskan trapper worried about being attacked by grizzly bears left the lights on in his cabin all the time. Plants just outside the cabin flowered a month early. Which of the following best explains this? They must have been long-day plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Plants have evolved a wide variety of responses that allow them to adapt to the variable environmental conditions in which they find themselves growing. One such response is the phototropic response-the bending of a plant organ toward (stems and leaves) or away from (roots) a directional blue light source.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What happens immediately after a phytochrome is activated by light? Ca2+ channels are opened and guanylyl cyclase is activated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Summary. The plant hormone ABA is a critical component of the stress acclimation mechanism in many plants. Plants produce ABA in response to a wide array of water associated stresses such as drought, salinity, cold and heat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Removal of the apical bud removes auxin from the plant, which has the effect of inhibiting lateral growth and allowing cytokinins to flow more freely in the plant, thereby encouraging lateral growth.
