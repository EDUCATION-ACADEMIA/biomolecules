<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-How does the air temperature affect the sweat level? As the temperature increased so did the sweat level, while as the temperature decreased the sweat level also decreased. B. The ability to maintain a steady internal temperature is called thermoregulation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Heat production is a function of metabolism. Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal muscles during exercise.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If your body needs to warm up, these mechanisms include: Vasoconstriction: The blood vessels under your skin become narrower. This decreases blood flow to your skin, retaining heat near the warm inner body. Thermogenesis: Your bodyâ€™s muscles, organs, and brain produce heat in various ways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-You might notice that in hot weather, you only produce small volumes of urine as the body is fighting to conserve water. If water is in excess, ADH levels are reduced limiting the amount of water resorbed back into the blood but increasing the volume eliminated in the urine.
