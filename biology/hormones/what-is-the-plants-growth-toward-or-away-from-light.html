<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In phototropism a plant bends or grows directionally in response to light. Shoots usually move towards the light; roots usually move away from it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Phototropism, or the differential cell elongation exhibited by a plant organ in response to directional blue light, provides the plant with a means to optimize photosynthetic light capture in the aerial portion and water and nutrient acquisition in the roots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plants have developed a number of strategies to capture the maximum amount of sunlight through their leaves. As we know from looking at plants on a windowsill, they grow toward the sunlight to be able to generate energy by photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Phototropism Examples Sunflower is a highly phototropic plant. They grow towards the sun and are also seen tracking the movement of the sun throughout the day. That is, the flower keeps changing its direction with the movement of the sun. Sunflower requires more light for its growth and survival.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-(a) The growth of plant parts in response to light is known as phototropism. An example of phototropism is the growth of plant stem in the upward direction in response to sunlight.
