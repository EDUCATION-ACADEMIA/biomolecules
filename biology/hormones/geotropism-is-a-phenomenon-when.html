<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The movement of the plant towards the response of gravity pull is known as geotropism. THe roots of the plant show positive stimuli as they grow in the direction of gravity and the stem reflects negative stimuli as it grows in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Explain to students that plants respond to different forces; sunflowers follow the light, pea tendrils grasp whatever they touch, and plants respond to gravity. This response to gravity is called Geotropism. Geotropism causes roots to grow downward, and stems and leaves to grow up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is Geotropism? The tropic movement in response to the earth’s gravity is called geotropism or gravitropism. Plant gravitropism can either be a positive or a negative response. Unilateral gravity causes curvature in the region of elongation of stem and root.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gravitropism is the ability of plants to perceive and respond to the gravity vector and orient themselves accordingly. The gravitropic pathway can be divided into three main components: perception, biochemical signaling, and differential growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-●The roots of a plant move downwards in the direction of gravity. ●The phenomenon showing this response of the plant part in the direction of gravity which is a stimulus, is known as geotropism.
