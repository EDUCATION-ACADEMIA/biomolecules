<strong> You have likely heard about the concept of a biological clock in organisms. An internal biological clock is what researchers think is behind the “sleep movements” of leaves exhibited in many plants. Which of the following is the leading hypothesis concerning the biological clock in plants? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Hormone production and utilization are used by the plant to sense time. 
</p>
<p>(B) There is a gene in plants that mutates at a set rate. These mutations are how the plant senses time. This is similar to the atomic clock. 
</p>
<p>(C) The biological clock depends on the environment to sense time. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** There is a protein feedback system in which protein molecules build up and are recycled at a set rate, allowing the plant to sense time.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Biological clocks are organisms’ natural timing devices, regulating the cycle of circadian rhythms. They’re composed of specific molecules (proteins) that interact with cells throughout the body. Nearly every tissue and organ contains biological clocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles that are part of the body’s internal clock, running in the background to carry out essential functions and processes. One of the most important and well-known circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The circadian biological clock is controlled by a part of the brain called the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), a group of cells in the hypothalamus that respond to light and dark signals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Plants, like many other organisms, have endogenous biological clocks that enable them to organize their physiological, metabolic and developmental processes so that they occur at optimal times. The best studied of these biological clocks are the circadian systems that regulate daily (approximately 24 h) rhythms.
