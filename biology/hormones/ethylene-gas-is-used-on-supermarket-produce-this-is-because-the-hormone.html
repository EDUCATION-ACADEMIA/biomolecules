<strong> Ethylene gas is used on supermarket produce. This is because the hormone: 
</strong>
<p>(A) Does not affect ripening of fruit 
</p>
<p>(B) Has no effect on plants 
</p>
<p>(C) Promotes root growth 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Promotes ripening of fruit

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ethylene is a gas and is known as the “fruit-ripening hormone.” Every fruit has a certain level of ethylene production throughout its lifecycle. However, in some fruits, ethylene levels shoot up when the fruit starts ripening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that plays an important role in inducing the ripening process for many fruits, together with other hormones and signals. An unripe fruit generally has low levels of ethylene. As the fruit matures, ethylene is produced as a signal to induce fruit ripening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene are the major regulators of ripening and senescence in both dry and fleshy fruits, as demonstrated by numerous ripening-defective mutants, effects of exogenous hormone application, and transcriptome analyses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ethylene is an important plant hormone. In bananas and many other fruits, production of ethylene surges when the fruit is ready to ripen. This surge triggers the transformation of a hard, green, dull fruit into a tender, gaudy, sweet thing that’s ready-to-eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Ethylene is regarded as a multifunctional phytohormone that regulates both growth, and senescence. It promotes or inhibits growth and senescence processes depending on its concentration, timing of application, and the plant species.
