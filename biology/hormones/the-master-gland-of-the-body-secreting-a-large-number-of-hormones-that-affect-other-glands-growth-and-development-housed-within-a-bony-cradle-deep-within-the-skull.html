<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The pituitary gland or the hypophysis cerebri is a vital structure of the human body as it performs essential functions for sustaining life. It has the pseudonym of “the master gland.” The location of the gland is within the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The pituitary gland is sometimes called the “master” gland of the endocrine system because it controls the functions of many of the other endocrine glands. The pituitary gland is no larger than a pea, and is located at the base of the brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer: Solution : The pituitary gland is considered the main endocrine gland. It is called the master gland because it produces hormones that control glands and many body functions including growth (growth hormone, Thyroid, and gonad stimulating hormone).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The hypothalamus is the master switchboard. It’s the part of the brain that controls the endocrine system. That pea-sized structure hanging below it is the pituitary gland. It’s called the master gland because it regulates the activity of the glands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Pituitary. The pituitary gland is located below the brain. Usually no larger than a pea, the gland controls many functions of the other endocrine glands.
