<p>(A) ** Auxins 
</p>
<p>(B) Cytokinins

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cytokinins promote lateral and adventitious shoot growth and are used to initiate shoot growth in culture and also help in overcoming apical dominance induced by auxins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Auxins function primarily in stem elongation by promoting cell growth. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the major naturally occurring auxin and one of the major growth factors in plants. They were the first group of plant growth hormones discovered. Auxins serve dual roles in plants depending on where they are produced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer: Auxin promotes cell growth and elongation of the plant. In the elongation process, auxin alters the plant wall plasticity making it easier for the plant to grow upwards. Auxin also influences rooting formations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plantâ€™s lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; in conjunction with ethylene, they promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Auxin and cytokinin are critical growth hormones in plant development and are naturally present within the plant at variable concentrations throughout the season.
