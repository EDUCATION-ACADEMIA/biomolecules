<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The plant hormone auxin is well known to stimulate cell elongation via increasing wall extensibility. Auxin participates in the regulation of cell wall properties by inducing wall loosening. Here, we review what is known on cell wall property regulation by auxin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The term elongation will be used for any permanent enlargement of cells already formed by differentiation. As the size of a plant cell is determined by the extent of the surface of its wall, cell elongation may be defined also as any permanent increase in the surface of the cell wall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-These are called meristems and are found in the tips of roots and shoots. Here new cells are formed. Plant cells are also able to become longer as they grow. This process is called cell elongation and occurs throughout the plant, not just in the meristems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Elongation Phase-These cells elongate due to enlargement of the vacuole present in the cell and hence that zone is called the zone of elongation. The cell enlargement and new cell wall formation take place in the cells present in the elongation phase. Modifications like larger vacuoles take place in the cells here.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Auxins function primarily in stem elongation by promoting cell growth. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the major naturally occurring auxin and one of the major growth factors in plants. They were the first group of plant growth hormones discovered. Auxins serve dual roles in plants depending on where they are produced.
