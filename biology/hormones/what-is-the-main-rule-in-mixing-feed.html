<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The principal objective in feed mixing is to assure that an animal receives all of its formulated nutrient allowances every day. Most feed manufacturers use the coefficient of variation or CV to measure mixer performance and mixture uniformity. The CV is defined as 100 * standard deviation/mean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process from raw material intake to finished feed pellets include many steps: It starts with dosing/weighing, followed by grinding, mixing, conditioning, expansion and pelleting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A mixture of just two single feeds is already called a mixed feed. However, modern mixed feeds are in fact highly complex compounds that are composed of several single feeds and selected additives and thus individually cover the specific, current nutrient requirements of the different animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The mixer performance can be affected by other factors such as particle size and shape of the ingredients, ingredient density, static charge, sequence at which ingredients are added, worn, altered, or broken equipment, improper mixer adjustment, poor mixer designed, and cleanliness.
