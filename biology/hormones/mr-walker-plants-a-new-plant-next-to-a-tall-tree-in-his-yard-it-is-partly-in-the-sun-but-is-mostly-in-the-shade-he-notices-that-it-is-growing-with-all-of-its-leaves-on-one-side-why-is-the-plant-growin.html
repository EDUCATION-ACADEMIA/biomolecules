<strong> Mr. Walker plants a new plant next to a tall tree in his yard. It is partly in the sun, but is mostly in the shade. He notices that it is growing with all of its leaves on one side. Why is the plant growing this way? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It’s dying 
</p>
<p>(B) ** It’s trying to get sunlight 
</p>
<p>(C) It’s trying to stay in the shade

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The leaves of a plant growing at the bottom are different from that floating on the surface. Hydrilla grows at the bottom of the pond as their leaves are small and pointed and the are also small while lotus is floating on the surface of the pond. These have large and round leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Plants have developed a number of strategies to capture the maximum amount of sunlight through their leaves. As we know from looking at plants on a windowsill, they grow toward the sunlight to be able to generate energy by photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The plant which is kept near the window of the classroom will turn towards the direction of the sunlight. This process is known as phototropism. There are different type of movements shown by the plants.
