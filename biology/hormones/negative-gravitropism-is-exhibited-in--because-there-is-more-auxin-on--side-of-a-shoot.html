<strong> Negative gravitropism is exhibited in ____, because there is more auxin on ____ side of a shoot. 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** shoots, shaded 
</p>
<p>(B) shoots, light 
</p>
<p>(C) roots, shaded 
</p>
<p>(D) roots, light

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When light hits one side of the coleoptile, the phototropins are more active on the side with light, causing the auxin to flow down the shady side. The side of the coleoptile with less auxin has less elongated cells, and the side with more auxin has more elongated cells, causing the tip to bend toward the light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Positive gravitropism occurs when roots grow into soil because they grow in the direction of gravity while negative gravitropism occurs when shoots grow up toward sunlight in the opposite direction of gravity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It grows because the auxin causes the cells to elongate on the shaded side, so this side grows more. This unequal growth of the two sides, results in the growth of the stem towards the light. If lit from above, the plant will grow upwards.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gravitropism is based on the redistribution of auxin in the elongation zone of the developing root. If the root is not growing vertically downward, then auxin accumulates in the lower parts of the root, inhibiting cell elongation and causing the root to bend in the direction of gravity.
