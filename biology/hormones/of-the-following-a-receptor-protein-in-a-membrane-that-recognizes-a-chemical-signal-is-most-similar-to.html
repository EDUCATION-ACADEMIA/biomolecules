<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cellular receptors are proteins either inside a cell or on its surface which receive a signal. In normal physiology, this is a chemical signal where a protein-ligand binds a protein receptor. The ligand is a chemical messenger released by one cell to signal either itself or a different cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Receptors are generally transmembrane proteins, which bind to signaling molecules outside the cell and subsequently transmit the signal through a sequence of molecular switches to internal signaling pathways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Intracellular receptors are receptor proteins found on the inside of the cell, typically in the cytoplasm or nucleus. In most cases, the ligands of intracellular receptors are small, hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, since they must be able to cross the plasma membrane in order to reach their receptors.
