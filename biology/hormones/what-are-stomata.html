<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-stomate, also called stoma, plural stomata or stomas, any of the microscopic openings or pores in the epidermis of leaves and young stems. Stomata are generally more numerous on the underside of leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Stomata are pores on the surfaces of leaves that function as bio-mechanical valves which control gas exchange in plants (Raven et al., 2005). Each stoma is bordered by a pair of curved, tubular guard cells (see Figure 1) that work together to control stomatal opening and closing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Leaves have many adaptations that make them well designed for photosynthesis. The flat surface of the leaf contains many tiny openings called stomata. These are like very small holes that allow carbon dioxide into the leaf – and oxygen out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Stomata are tiny openings or pores in plant tissue that allow for gas exchange. Stomata are typically found in plant leaves but can also be found in some stems. Specialized cells known as guard cells surround stomata and function to open and close stomatal pores.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Stomata regulate gas exchange between the plant and environment and control of water loss by changing the size of the stomatal pore.
