<meta name="description" content="A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo-= inside), or an exocrine gland whose secretions leave through a duct that opens to the external environment (exo-= outside).Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in organs with these functions, such as the ducts of the salivary glands, liver, pancreas and other exocrine glands. It forms thyroid follicles, kidney tubules, seminiferous tubules of male testis, and covers the surface of the ovaries (germinal epithelium).Exocrine glands release their secretory products into a duct which opens into a specific part of the body (e.g. skin, stomach, respiratory tract).

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo-= “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose secretions leave through a duct that opens to the external environment (exo-= “outside”).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in organs with these functions, such as the ducts of the salivary glands, liver, pancreas and other exocrine glands. It forms thyroid follicles, kidney tubules, seminiferous tubules of male testis, and covers the surface of the ovaries (germinal epithelium).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Exocrine glands release their secretory products into a duct which opens into a specific part of the body (e.g. skin, stomach, respiratory tract). Some examples of exocrine glands include the sweat glands, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands, among others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Exocrine glands secrete their substances through ducts onto your body’s surfaces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Glandular epithelium is composed of cells specialized to secrete substances. Exocrine glands secrete into ducts. Endocrine glands secrete intro tissue fluid or blood.
