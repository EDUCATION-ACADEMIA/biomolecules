<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ethylene plays a vital role in the natural ripening of fruits. It is a hormone produced naturally within the fruits to stimulate ripening process. Ethylene, being a natural hormone, does not pose any health hazards to consumers, the guidance note points out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This increase in ethylene concentration triggers an increase in the fruit’s metabolism and causes the changes to the fruit that occur during ripening. Ripening of climacteric fruits can, therefore, be slowed down by reducing the amount of ethylene the fruits make or by blocking ethylene’s actions [5].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that plays an important role in inducing the ripening process for many fruits, together with other hormones and signals. An unripe fruit generally has low levels of ethylene. As the fruit matures, ethylene is produced as a signal to induce fruit ripening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that causes fruit to mature. It is abundantly synthesised in the fruits and tissues undergoing ripening and senescence, respectively. Ethylene promotes the ripening of fruits such as tomatoes, lemons, and oranges. It also has the effect of increasing the rate of breathing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-During ripening, the fruit becomes softer and starches are converted to sugar, making the fruit sweeter. Ethylene triggers ripening, and ripening triggers more ethylene production, accelerating the process. This is a classic example of a positive feedback mechanism.
