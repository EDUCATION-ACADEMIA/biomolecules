<meta name="description" content="The adrenal gland releases too little of the hormone cortisol and sometimes, aldosterone. Symptoms include fatigue, stomach upset, dehydration, and skin changes. Addisons disease is a type of adrenal insufficiency.Hormone disorders occur when a gland produces too much or too little of a hormone. Hormone disorders can be caused by many things, including being exposed to certain chemicals in the environment.Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism.Some reports have included minor weight gain, fatigue, moodiness, foggy thinking and headaches. Others have reported significant symptoms such as extreme fatigue, significant weight gain, erratic and frequent mood swings, slowed or accelerated growth, low testosterone, and delayed or early puberty.">
