<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Abscisic acid is then translocated from the roots to the leaves. Abscisic acid reduces the turgor of the guard cells causing them to close. This reduces plant transpiration, or the evaporation of water out of the stomata of leaves, and therefore prevents water loss and wilting in times of low moisture or drought.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It has an essential role in multiple physiological processes of plants, such as stomatal closure, cuticular wax accumulation, leaf senescence, bud dormancy, seed germination, osmotic regulation, and growth inhibition among many others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Stomata – Guard cells surrounds the stomata causing a doorway effect, which could be increasing (swollen) or decreasing (shrunken) in size. When the guard cells are swollen, stomata is sealed causing less water loss through transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Transpiration helps in the conduction of water and minerals to different parts of the plants. Due to the continuous elimination of water from the plant body, there is a balance of water maintained within the plant. It maintains osmosis and keeps the cells rigid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-abscisic acid (AbA), a plant growth regulator promotes the closure of stomata. This reduces the transpiration rate and increases the water stress resistance capacity of the plant.
