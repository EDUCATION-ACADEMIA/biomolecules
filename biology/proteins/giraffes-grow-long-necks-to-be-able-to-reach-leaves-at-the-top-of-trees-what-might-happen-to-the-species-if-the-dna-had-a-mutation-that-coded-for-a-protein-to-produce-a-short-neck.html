<strong> Giraffes grow long necks to be able to reach leaves at the top of trees. What might happen to the species if the DNA had a mutation that coded for a protein to produce a short neck.

<p>(A) The giraffes would learn to grow claws to compete with the lions for food.

<p>(B) ** The giraffe may decrease in population

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It appears obvious: the giraffe’s neck, which can grow to as much as two metres in length, has been selected because it gives its owner exclusive access to the topmost leaves of the trees, and no other animal can reach them. This, then, is an adaptation designed to avoid competition for food with other animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A Darwinian theory of evolution posits that it was through random variation that some giraffes had longer necks than others. Thanks to their long necks, they were able to reach leaves high up in the trees in their environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Charles Darwin held up giraffes as a prime example of natural selection, his theory that’s often summarized as “survival of the fittest.” Giraffes with comparably longer necks could reach food high up in trees, which gave them an advantage over other animals and members of their own species with shorter necks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Giraffe’s long-neck evolution has long been attributed to foraging for sustenance in the high canopy, now researchers argue that selection for head-butting combat played a role in the long length of giraffe necks.
