<meta name="description" content="Enzymes are mostly proteins that catalyze various biochemical reactions. The catalytic reaction occurs through a specific region (active site) where the substrate bind. Enzymes show the highest activity at a specific temperature called optimum temperature. High heat destroys enzymes.Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range.If your stomach doesnt have enough acid, pepsin cant function optimally. Temperature: Enzymes work best when your body temperature is normal, about 98.6°F (37°C). As temperature increases, enzyme reactions increase. But if the temperature gets too high, the enzyme stops working.Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are mostly proteins that catalyze various biochemical reactions. The catalytic reaction occurs through a specific region (active site) where the substrate bind. Enzymes show the highest activity at a specific temperature called ‘optimum temperature’. High heat destroys enzymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If your stomach doesn’t have enough acid, pepsin can’t function optimally. Temperature: Enzymes work best when your body temperature is normal, about 98.6°F (37°C). As temperature increases, enzyme reactions increase. But if the temperature gets too high, the enzyme stops working.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.
