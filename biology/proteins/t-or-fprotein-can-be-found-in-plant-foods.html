<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Plant protein Cramer: Certain plants can be excellent sources of protein, often with fewer calories and fewer potentially harmful effects than animal products. Some plant proteins, such as quinoa, are complete proteins-which means they contain all 9 essential amino acids that we need.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-These four types of plant proteins are mainly associated with seed storage proteins and are known as albumins, globulins, prolamins and glutelins, separated based on Osborne fractionation with water, salt, alcohol, and alkali, respectively (Table 1).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plant proteins, mostly globulins, have been obtained chiefly from the protein-rich seeds of cereals and legumes. Small amounts of albumins are found in seeds. The best known globulins, insoluble in water, can be extracted from seeds by treatment with 2 to 10 percent solutions of sodium chloride.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid.
