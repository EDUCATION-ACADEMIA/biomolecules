<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-1: Amino acids undergo condensation to form a molecule called a dipeptide. The C−N bond is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is the amide bond that occurs between the amine nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of another amino acid. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When two amino acids form a dipeptide through a peptide bond, it is a type of condensation reaction. In this kind of condensation, two amino acids approach each other, with the non-side chain (C1) carboxylic acid moiety of one coming near the non-side chain (N2) amino moiety of the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When two amino acids combine in a condensation reaction, a covalent bond forms between the carboxyl carbon of one amino acid and the amine nitrogen of the second amino acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A peptide bond is a chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, releasing a molecule of water (H2O). This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids are joined together by a peptide bond. The peptide bond is formed via dehydration synthesis when a hydroxyl is removed from amino acid 1 and a hydrogen is removed from amino acid 2 to form water as a byproduct. The resulting C-N bond is a peptide bond.
