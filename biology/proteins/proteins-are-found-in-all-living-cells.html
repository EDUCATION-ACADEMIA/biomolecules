<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Protein molecules, like DNA and RNA molecules, are long unbranched polymer chains, formed by the stringing together of monomeric building blocks drawn from a standard repertoire that is the same for all living cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins are the key working molecules and building blocks in all cells. They are produced in a similar two-step process in all organisms called protein synthesis – DNA is first transcribed into RNA, then RNA is translated into protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proteins are the molecules that do most of the work within a cell. They range from things like actin and myosin, which collaborate to flex muscle cells-and thus the muscles of which those cells are part-to the enzymes of the Krebs cycle, which disassemble glucose to release the energy therein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Most of the remaining proteins are located in structures common to all cell types such as the cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-All living cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, have a plasma membrane that encloses their contents and serves as a semi-porous barrier to the outside environment. The membrane acts as a boundary, holding the cell constituents together and keeping other substances from entering.
