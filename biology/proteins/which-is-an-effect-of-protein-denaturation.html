<strong> Which is an effect of protein denaturation? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The order of amino acids is changed when the protein overheats. 
</p>
<p>(B) The bonds between amino acids are broken by condensation. 
</p>
<p>(C) Parts of the protein become linked together by hydrolysis. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The three-dimensional structure of the protein is altered.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During the denaturation of proteins, the secondary and tertiary structures get destroyed and only the primary structure is retained. Covalent bonds are broken and interaction between amino-acid chains gets disrupted. This results in the loss of biological activity of the proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Denaturation and protein folding If the temperature or pH of a proteinâ€™s environment is changed, or if it is exposed to chemicals, these interactions may be disrupted, causing the protein to lose its three-dimensional structure and turn back into an unstructured string of amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: When a protein is denatured, it loses its tertiary structure and keeps its primary structure. The tertiary structure of a protein is the three-dimensional shape that it takes to become functional while the primary structure of a protein is the amino acid sequence of the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The amino acid sequence of a protein determines its three-dimensional shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As a result of denaturation, globules get unfolded and helixes get uncoiled. Secondary and tertiary structures of protein are destroyed, but the primary structures remain unaltered. It can be said that during denaturation, secondary and tertiary-structured proteins get converted into primary-structured proteins.
