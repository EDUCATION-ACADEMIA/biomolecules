<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cells must produce many different enzymes because: rate of production of enzymes is important in regulating energy production by cells. enzymes are degraded quickly. most cellular reactions require a specific, unique enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The human body needs many different enzymes because of all of its complex metabolic activities and processes. The enzymes act as catalysts to the various metabolic chemical reactions that take place, and once the enzyme is used to catalyze a reaction, it’s gone, so it needs to be replaced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each enzyme has an “active site.” This area has a unique shape. The substance an enzyme works on is a substrate. The substrate also has a unique shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Each cell contains thousands of enzymes, providing specific help throughout the body. Enzymes help with the chemical reactions that keep a person alive and well. For example, they perform a necessary function for metabolism, the process of breaking down food and drink into energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-All enzymes isolated thus far are specific for the type of chemical reaction they catalyze-i.e., oxidoreductases do not catalyze hydrolase reactions, and hydrolases do not catalyze reactions involving oxidation and reduction.
