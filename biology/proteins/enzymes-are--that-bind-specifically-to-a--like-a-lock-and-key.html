<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Lock-and-key model is a model for enzyme-substrate interaction suggesting that the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another. Enzymes are highly specific. They must bind to a specific substrate before they can catalyze a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The lock-and-key theory of enzyme action proposes that the enzyme’s active site and the shape of the substrate molecule are complementary to one another. This allows the substrate to fit into the enzyme, like how a key would fit into a lock. If the substrate doesn’t fit, then the enzyme will not act on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Induced fit Instead, an enzyme changes shape slightly when it binds its substrate, resulting in an even tighter fit. This adjustment of the enzyme to snugly fit the substrate is called induced fit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the lock and key mechanism, the binding pockets for the substrates exist in full form in the free enzyme. The substrates readily bind and the reaction is driven because the active site has better complementarity to the transition state of the reaction than to the substrates at the ground state.
