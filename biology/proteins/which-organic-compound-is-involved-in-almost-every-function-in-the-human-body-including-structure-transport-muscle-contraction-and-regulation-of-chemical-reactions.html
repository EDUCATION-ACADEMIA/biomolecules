<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-ATP is consumed for energy in processes including ion transport, muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, substrate phosphorylation, and chemical synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins. Proteins are probably the most versatile of all the organic molecules, making up many structures and executing various functions within organisms. Building blocks called amino acids make up proteins. About 20 different amino acids combine to form all of the various types of proteins on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proteins make up much of the structure of cells. Lipids are energy-rich organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids contain more energy than carbohydrates. Cells store energy in lipids for later use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Proteins. Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Humans obtain energy from three classes of fuel molecules: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
