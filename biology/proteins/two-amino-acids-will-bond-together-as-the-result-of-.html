<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A peptide bond is formed by a dehydration synthesis or reaction at a molecular level. This reaction is also known as a condensation reaction which usually occurs between amino acids. As depicted in the figure given below, two amino acids bond together to form a peptide bond by the dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Amino acids are attached to other amino acids by covalent bonds, known as peptide bonds, which are formed by dehydration synthesis reactions. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water and forming a peptide bond (Figure 3.7).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It is a peptide bond formation reaction which occurs between two amino acid molecules. The amino group of one molecule and carboxyl group of another molecule condenses with the elimination of water molecules and form an amide linkage in dipeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The monomers that are joined via dehydration synthesis reactions share electrons and form covalent bonds with each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When amino acids link together through a covalent bond called a peptide bond, they will form larger three-dimensional structures called proteins or peptides.
