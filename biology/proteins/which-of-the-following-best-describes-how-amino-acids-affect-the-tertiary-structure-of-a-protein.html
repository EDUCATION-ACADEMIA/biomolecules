<strong> which of the following best describes how amino acids affect the tertiary structure of a protein? 
</strong>
<p>(A) the number of amino acids determines the tertiary structure of the protein 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the interactions of the different R-groups with other R-groups and with their environment determine the tertiary structure of the protein 
</p>
<p>(C) the R-group of the last amino acid that is added to a growing polypeptide chain determines the next amino acid that is added to the chain 
</p>
<p>(D) the sequence of the amino acids in the polypeptide chain determines the protein’s primary structure but has no effect on it’s tertiary structure

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes how amino acids affect the tertiary structure of a protein? The interactions of the different R-groups with other R-groups and with their environment determine the tertiary structure of the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Tertiary structure The sequence of amino acids of a protein determines protein shape, since the chemical properties of each amino acid are forces that give rise to intermolecular interactions to begin to create secondary structures, such as -helices and -strands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The tertiary structure is primarily due to interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the tertiary structure of a protein? AThe tertiary structure of a protein is the folded structure (alpha-helix or beta-sheet) formed by additional bonds that are formed in the polypeptide chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Covalent Bonds-Disulfide Bridges Cysteine is the sole amino acid whose side chain can form covalent bonds, yielding disulfide bridges with other cysteine side chains:–CH2-S-S-CH2–.
