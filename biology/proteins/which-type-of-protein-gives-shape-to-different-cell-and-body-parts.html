<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Messenger proteins, such as some types of hormones, transmit signals to coordinate biological processes between different cells, tissues, and organs. These proteins provide structure and support for cells. On a larger scale, they also allow the body to move.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Quaternary protein Proteins fold up into specific shapes according to the sequence of amino acids in the polymer, and the protein function is directly related to the resulting 3D structure. Proteins may also interact with each other or other macromolecules in the body to create complex assemblies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-For example, structural proteins maintain cell shape, akin to a skeleton, and they compose structural elements in connective tissues like cartilage and bone in vertebrates. Enzymes are another type of protein, and these molecules catalyze the biochemical reactions that occur in cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The shape of a protein is solely determined by the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain. That’s right; it is just like DNA, unique code makes a unique design. Protein folding is the result of physical properties of amino acids’ side chains and their interactions with the environment around them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The different levels of protein structure are known as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.
