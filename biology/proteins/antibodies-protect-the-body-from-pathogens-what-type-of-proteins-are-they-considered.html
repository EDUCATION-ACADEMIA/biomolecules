<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Antibodies also can: neutralize toxins (poisonous or damaging substances) produced by different organisms. activate a group of proteins called complement that are part of the immune system. Complement helps kill bacteria, viruses, or infected cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Antibodies are protective proteins produced by your immune system. They attach to antigens (foreign substances)-such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins-and remove them from your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Antibodies are generated by the adaptive immune system, and, like complement proteins, they tag foreign substances to enhance their removal by phagocytic cells. However, unlike complement, antibodies are highly specific in their ability to identify pathogens and foreign substances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Antibodies are defensive proteins that have binding sites whose three-dimensional structure allows them to identify and bind to very specific foreign molecules. By binding to foreign proteins they can help neutralize them and tag them, facilitating their engulfment and removal by defensive cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Antibodies are immune system-related proteins called immunoglobulins. Each antibody consists of four polypeptides– two heavy chains and two light chains joined to form a “Y” shaped molecule.
