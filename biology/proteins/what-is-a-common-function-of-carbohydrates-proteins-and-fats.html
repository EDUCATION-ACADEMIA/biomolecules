<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These nutrients are digested into simpler compounds. Carbohydrates are used for energy (glucose). Fats are used for energy after they are broken into fatty acids. Protein can also be used for energy, but the first job is to help with making hormones, muscle, and other proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If all three nutrients are abundant in the diet, carbohydrates and fats are used mainly for energy while proteins help make hormones, muscle and other proteins. Proteins in food are broken down into pieces called amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The carbohydrates break down the glucose in our body, and they are transmitted to various parts of the body through the bloodstream and help in body function. The body in the rest condition uses glucose as a primary energy source. The protein helps to repair body tissue and allows to perform the metabolic reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Carbohydrates (starches and sugars), fat, and protein within food can all function as sources of energy when they are metabolized to carbon dioxide and water in respiration processes in all of our bodyâ€™s cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Storing Energy The excess energy from the food we eat is incorporated into adipose tissue, or fatty tissue. Most of the energy required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates unit, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen.
