<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A student argues that because of this, proteins need to have a wide variety of structures. Which of the following statements about proteins BEST supports the student’s argument? Proteins can be made up of any combination of 20 different amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins have impressive chemical capabilities because the neighboring chemical groups on their surface often interact in ways that enhance the chemical reactivity of amino acid side chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The sequence of amino acids determines each protein’s unique 3-dimensional structure and its specific function. Amino acids are coded by combinations of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), determined by the sequence of genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The versatility of proteins arises because of their varied structures. Proteins are made by linking together amino acids, with each protein having a characteristic and unique amino acid sequence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form long chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones.
