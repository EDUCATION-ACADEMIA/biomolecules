<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A characteristic shared by all enzymes, hormones, and antibodies is that their function is determined by the shape of their molecules. This is because all of these molecules bind to specific targets and these interactions are mediated by molecular geometry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An enzyme’s shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids in its structure, and the bonds which form between the atoms of those molecules. Why do enzymes have different shapes? Different types of enzymes have different shapes and functions because the order and type of amino acids in their structure is different.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are actually made up of thousands of amino acids that are linked in a specific way to form different enzymes. The enzyme chains fold over to form unique shapes and it is these shapes that provide the enzyme with its characteristic chemical potential.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which statement describes a similarity between all enzymes, antibodies and hormones? Their chemical structure is critical to their ability of function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The common property of all proteins is that they consist of long chains of -amino (alpha amino) acids. The general structure of -amino acids is shown in . The -amino acids are so called because the -carbon atom in the molecule carries an amino group (―NH2); the -carbon atom also carries a carboxyl group (―COOH).
