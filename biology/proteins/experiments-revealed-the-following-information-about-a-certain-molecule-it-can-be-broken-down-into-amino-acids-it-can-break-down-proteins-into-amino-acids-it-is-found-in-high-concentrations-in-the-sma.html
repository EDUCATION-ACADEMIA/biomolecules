<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes (/ˈɛnzaɪmz/) are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The breaking down of complex organic molecules occurs via catabolic pathways and usually involves the release of energy. Through catabolic pathways, polymers such as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides are reduced to their constituent parts: amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars, respectively.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Of these five components, pepsin is the principal enzyme involved in protein digestion. It breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids that can be easily absorbed in the small intestine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Protein foods are broken down into parts called amino acids during digestion. The human body needs a number of amino acids in large enough amounts to maintain good health. Amino acids are found in animal sources such as meats, milk, fish, and eggs.
