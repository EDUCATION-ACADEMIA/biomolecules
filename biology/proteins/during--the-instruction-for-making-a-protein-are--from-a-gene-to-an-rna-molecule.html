<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During the process of transcription, the information stored in a geneâ€™s DNA is passed to a similar molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid) in the cell nucleus. Both RNA and DNA are made up of a chain of building blocks called nucleotides, but they have slightly different chemical properties.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During translation, ribosomal subunits assemble together like a sandwich on the strand of mRNA, where they proceed to attract tRNA molecules tethered to amino acids (circles). A long chain of amino acids emerges as the ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence into a polypeptide, or a new protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence near the beginning of a gene (directly or through helper proteins). RNA polymerase uses one of the DNA strands (the template strand) as a template to make a new, complementary RNA molecule. Transcription ends in a process called termination.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The process by which DNA is copied to RNA is called transcription, and that by which RNA is used to produce proteins is called translation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Translation Translation takes place on ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm, where mRNA is read and translated into the string of amino acid chains that make up the synthesized protein.
