<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Marbling in beef refers to the visible white streaks of intramuscular fat that run throughout the muscle tissue in any particular cut. Highly marbled steaks and others cuts of beef are highly sought after, as the intramuscular fat liquifies during the cooking process and provides a kind of self-marinating effect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Marbling is the fine flecks of fat that appear within the muscles of red meat (also referred to as intramuscular fat). It’s deposited unevenly throughout the body, with most found at the front in cuts like scotch fillet, rib eye, and blade.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Marbling is technically known as Intramuscular Fat, or IMF for short. When looking at a raw steak, marbling is the white fat streaks or flecks mingling in the red meat of that steak. These flecks of fat are what give beef its soft texture and carries the flavor throughout each bite.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Marbling is the white flecks of intramuscular fat in meat, most notably red meat. The fat in lean muscle creates a marble pattern-hence the name. Marbling affects meat’s juiciness, tenderness, texture, and flavor-attributes that determine “eating experience.” In this case, more of all the above is better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Intramuscular fat (Fig. 5.14) is located between and within muscle fibers (cells) and its greatest deposition is in the later stages of the growth process. Intramuscular fat is called marbling in the meat industry and marbling has a significant impact on marketing fresh meat, particularly beef and pork loin cuts.
