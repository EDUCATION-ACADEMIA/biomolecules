<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Muscle contraction thus results from an interaction between the actin and myosin filaments that generates their movement relative to one another. The molecular basis for this interaction is the binding of myosin to actin filaments, allowing myosin to function as a motor that drives filament sliding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The myofibrillar protein components most important for muscle fiber structure are actin and myosin. They are the most abundant proteins in muscle and are directly involved in the ability of muscle to contract and to relax.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proteins inside muscles enable them to contract. The main proteins involved in muscle contraction are called actin and myosin. These are arranged in repeating rows with the actin fibers anchored to a dense plate called a Z-disc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-‌Your muscles contain fibers called myosin. Depending on how you need to use your muscles, the myosin fibers either tighten up and shorten or loosen up and stretch out. Myosin is also responsible for muscle contractions like your heartbeat that happens at regular intervals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In all muscle types, the contractile apparatus consists of two main proteins: actin and myosin. Striated muscle is so called because the regular arrangement of alternating actomyosin fibers gives it a striped appearance.
