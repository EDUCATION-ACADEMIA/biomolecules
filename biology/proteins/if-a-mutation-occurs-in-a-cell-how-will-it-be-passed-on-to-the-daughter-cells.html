<title>If a mutation occurs in a cell, how will it be passed on to the daughter cells?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Germ-line mutations occur in reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) and are passed to an organisms offspring during sexual reproduction. Somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells; they are passed to daughter cells during mitosis but not to offspring during sexual reproduction.Some mutations are hereditary because they are passed down to an offspring from a parent carrying a mutation through the germ line, meaning through an egg or sperm cell carrying the mutation. There are also nonhereditary mutations that occur in cells outside of the germ line, which are called somatic mutations.Yes, you can inherit germline genetic mutations, while somatic mutations occur with no previous history of the mutation in your family. There are several patterns that genetic mutations can pass from the parent to a child (hereditary).Gene variants, including mutations, can be either inherited or acquired. An inherited gene mutation, as the name implies, is inherited from a parent, so its present in the very first cell (once the egg cell is fertilized by a sperm cell) that eventually becomes a person.If an acquired mutation occurs in an egg or sperm cell, it can be passed down to the individuals offspring. Once an acquired mutation is passed down, it is a hereditary mutation. Acquired mutations are not passed down if they occur in the somatic cells, meaning body cells other than sperm cells and egg cells.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Germ-line mutations occur in reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) and are passed to an organism’s offspring during sexual reproduction. Somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells; they are passed to daughter cells during mitosis but not to offspring during sexual reproduction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Some mutations are hereditary because they are passed down to an offspring from a parent carrying a mutation through the germ line, meaning through an egg or sperm cell carrying the mutation. There are also nonhereditary mutations that occur in cells outside of the germ line, which are called somatic mutations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Yes, you can inherit germline genetic mutations, while somatic mutations occur with no previous history of the mutation in your family. There are several patterns that genetic mutations can pass from the parent to a child (hereditary).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gene variants, including mutations, can be either inherited or acquired. An inherited gene mutation, as the name implies, is inherited from a parent, so it’s present in the very first cell (once the egg cell is fertilized by a sperm cell) that eventually becomes a person.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If an acquired mutation occurs in an egg or sperm cell, it can be passed down to the individual’s offspring. Once an acquired mutation is passed down, it is a hereditary mutation. Acquired mutations are not passed down if they occur in the somatic cells, meaning body cells other than sperm cells and egg cells.
