<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Most pre-mRNA molecules have sections that are removed from the molecule, called introns, and sections that are linked or together to make the final mRNA, called exons. This process is called splicing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Splicing removes introns from the protein-coding sequence of mRNA. Introns are regions that do not code for the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The process of removing the introns and rejoining the coding sections or exons, of the mRNA, is called splicing. Once the mRNA has been capped, spliced and had a polyA tail added, it is sent from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Introns must be removed and exons ligated together to form a mature mRNA. This process, called pre-mRNA splicing, allows an additional layer of genetic complexity as alternative splicing of exons into the final mRNA can control transcript abundance and protein isoform production.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Splicing is the process of removal of intron sequences and joining the exon sequences.
