<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino acids, which are attached to one another in long chains. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Background. Glycine is the smallest nonessential amino acid and has previously unrecognized neurotherapeutic effects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proteins are made of subunits called amino acids and are used to build cells and do much of the work inside organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Each polypeptide chain in such a protein is called a protein subunit. In the simplest case, two identical folded polypeptide chains bind to each other in a “head-to-head” arrangement, forming a symmetric complex of two protein subunits (a dimer) held together by interactions between two identical binding sites.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins are often found as long polymers in nature. Because of their polymeric nature and their large (sometimes huge!) size, they are classified as macromolecules, big (macro-) molecules made through the joining of smaller subunits.
