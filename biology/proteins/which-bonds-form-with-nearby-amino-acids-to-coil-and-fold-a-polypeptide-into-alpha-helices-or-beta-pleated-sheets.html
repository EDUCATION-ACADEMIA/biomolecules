<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Primary structure refers to the linear sequence of the amino acids connected by the peptide bonds. The secondary structure consists of local packing of polypeptide chain into -helices and -sheets due to hydrogen bonds between peptide bond – central carbon backbone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>--helices are formed and maintained by backbone interactions parallel to the primary axis of the helix. These interactions are hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen and amino nitrogen of the ith and i + 4th amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The most common types of secondary structures are the helix and the pleated sheet. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds, which form between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Alpha-Helix and Beta-Pleated sheets are types of the secondary structure of the protein. They both are shaped by hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl O of one amino acid and the amino H of another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-To form polypeptides and proteins, amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds, in which the amino or NH2 of one amino acid bonds to the carboxyl (acid) or COOH group of another amino acid as shown in (Figure 19.1. 2 and Figure 19.1.
