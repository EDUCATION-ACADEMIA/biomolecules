<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-But, if you’re physically active, you’ll need more than this minimum daily recommended amount. It’s hard to argue with tuna if you’re looking to increase your intake of complete protein . With so much pure, complete protein per serving and so little fat, tuna provides all the essential amino acids you need.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Protein. Tuna is very high in protein. A can of tuna provides 42 grams of complete protein with all of the essential amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Foods that contain all nine essential amino acids are called complete proteins. These foods include beef, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, quinoa and buckwheat. Foods that contain some but not all the essential amino acids are called incomplete proteins. These foods include nuts, seeds, beans and some grains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
