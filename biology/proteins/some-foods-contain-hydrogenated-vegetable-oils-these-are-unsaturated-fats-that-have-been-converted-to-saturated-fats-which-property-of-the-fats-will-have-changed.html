<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Some foods contain ‘hydrogenated vegetable oils’. These are unsaturated fats that have been converted to saturated fats. Which property of the fats will have changed? A Their hydrocarbon chains will fit together more closely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An unsaturated fat can be made in to a saturated fat via hydrogenation reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Trans fats are the result of partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fat. Trans fats increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Canadians have one of the highest dietary intake of trans fat in the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Unsaturated fats can undergo a hydrogenation reaction, a chemical reaction that changes their double bonds to single bonds. The unsaturated fat reacts with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst (normally palladium, platinum, or nickel). This reaction reduces the number of double bonds in original fat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Building blocks of fat The close packing of these blocks is similar to the tightly packed molecules that make saturated fats appear solid. The building blocks of unsaturated fats have bends or kinks that don’t allow the blocks to be tightly stacked and thus, appear more fluid and are liquid at room temperature.
