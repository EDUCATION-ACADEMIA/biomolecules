<meta name="description" content="The correct answer is A. The sites of protein synthesis are the mitochondria of cells.. This is not a true statement about protein synthesis.The correct answer option is (B). The process of synthesis of proteins according to the sequence of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is known as translation. The process of translation is catalyzed by ribosome molecules.Thus, the correct answer is option They contain genetic information.Enzymes are proteins made up of amino acids and acts as biological catalysts in our body.
