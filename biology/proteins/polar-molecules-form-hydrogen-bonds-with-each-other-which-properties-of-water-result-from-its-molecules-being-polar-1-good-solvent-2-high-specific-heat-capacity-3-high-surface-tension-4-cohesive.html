<title>Polar molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other. Which properties of water result from its molecules being polar? 1 good solvent 2 high specific heat capacity 3 high surface tension 4 cohesive

<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: Two properties of water that result from the polar bonding between its molecules are cohesion and adhesion.The property of cohesion describes the ability of water molecules to be attracted to other water molecules, which allows water to be a sticky liquid. Hydrogen bonds are attractions of electrostatic force caused by the difference in charge between slightly positive hydrogen ions and other, slightly negative ions.Hydrogen bonds cause water to be exceptionally attracted to each other. Therefore, water is very cohesive. We see evidence of waters cohesiveness every day – in water drops and in streams of water.As a result of waters polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between them, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts, or is attracted to, other polar molecules and ions, including many biomolecules, such as sugars, nucleic acids, and some amino acids.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Two properties of water that result from the polar bonding between its molecules are cohesion and adhesion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The property of cohesion describes the ability of water molecules to be attracted to other water molecules, which allows water to be a “sticky” liquid. Hydrogen bonds are attractions of electrostatic force caused by the difference in charge between slightly positive hydrogen ions and other, slightly negative ions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonds cause water to be exceptionally attracted to each other. Therefore, water is very cohesive. We see evidence of water’s cohesiveness every day – in water drops and in streams of water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-As a result of water’s polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between them, forming hydrogen bonds. Water also attracts, or is attracted to, other polar molecules and ions, including many biomolecules, such as sugars, nucleic acids, and some amino acids.
