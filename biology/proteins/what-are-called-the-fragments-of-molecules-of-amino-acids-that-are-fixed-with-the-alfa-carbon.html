<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Chemically, an amino acid is a molecule that has a carboxylic acid group and an amine group that are each attached to a carbon atom called the carbon. Each of the 20 amino acids has a specific side chain, known as an R group, that is also attached to the carbon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>--Helices, -sheets, and triple helices are three types of secondary structures. All are formed and stabilized by noncovalent interactions, mainly hydrogen bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An alpha helix is an element of secondary structure in which the amino acid chain is arranged in a spiral. The kinemage linked above shows an individual alpha helix, viewed from the N-terminal end to resemble the “helical wheel” (see figure below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In fact, cysteines are the only amino acids capable of forming covalent bonds, which they do with their particular side chains. Because of side chain interactions, the sequence and location of amino acids in a particular protein guides where the bends and folds occur in that protein (Figure 1).
