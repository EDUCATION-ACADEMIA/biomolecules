Explanation: Enzymes are biological molecules that help catalyze reactions by lowering the energy of activation and increasing the rate of a reaction.Like all other catalysts, enzymes are characterized by two fundamental properties. First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction.
