<title>What happens when proteins are heated to a high temperature?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.At high temperatures the shape of the enzyme is altered so that it is no longer complementary to its specific substrate. This effect can be permanent and irreversible and is called denaturation . The diagram below shows what happens to an enzyme when denaturation occurs.It is determined that the protein molecule expands slightly (0.4% per 100 K) with increasing temperature and that this expansion is linear. The expansion is due primarily to subtle repacking of the molecule, with exposed and mobile loop regions exhibiting the largest movements.The higher the temperature, the more an enzyme will vibrate. If it vibrates enough it will distort out of shape, or denature. If the temperature goes up even more, the different regions of the protein will swing so far apart from each other that they cant come back .Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-At high temperatures the shape of the enzyme is altered so that it is no longer complementary to its specific substrate. This effect can be permanent and irreversible and is called denaturation . The diagram below shows what happens to an enzyme when denaturation occurs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It is determined that the protein molecule expands slightly (0.4% per 100 K) with increasing temperature and that this expansion is linear. The expansion is due primarily to subtle repacking of the molecule, with exposed and mobile loop regions exhibiting the largest movements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The higher the temperature, the more an enzyme will vibrate. If it vibrates enough it will distort out of shape, or denature. If the temperature goes up even more, the different regions of the protein will swing so far apart from each other that they can’t come back .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.
