<title>Which of the following best describes DEAMINATION?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Deamination is the removal of the amine group (NH2) from an amino acid . When a protein undergoes digestion, deamination can take place, which is the removal of an amine group from an amino acid. This answer is correct.In situations of excess protein intake, deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia. The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy.The correct option is C deamination. During digestion, proteins are broken down into amino acids and nucleic acids are converted into nitrogenous bases. Next step of protein and nucleic acid digestion is deamination. Deamination is removal of amino groups.Deamination is the removal of an amine group from a molecule. In the human body, deamination takes place in the liver. It is the process by which amino acids are broken down. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia.the removal of the amino nitrogen occurs during the process of transamination and oxidative deamination. Increased deamination results in an increased production of ammonia which is consumed in the urea cycle. Urea, a hydrophilic non-toxic compound, is excreted by the kidneys into the urine.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deamination is the removal of the amine group (NH2) from an amino acid . When a protein undergoes digestion, deamination can take place, which is the removal of an amine group from an amino acid. This answer is correct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In situations of excess protein intake, deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia. The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The correct option is C deamination. During digestion, proteins are broken down into amino acids and nucleic acids are converted into nitrogenous bases. Next step of protein and nucleic acid digestion is deamination. Deamination is removal of amino groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Deamination is the removal of an amine group from a molecule. In the human body, deamination takes place in the liver. It is the process by which amino acids are broken down. The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-the removal of the amino nitrogen occurs during the process of transamination and oxidative deamination. Increased deamination results in an increased production of ammonia which is consumed in the urea cycle. Urea, a hydrophilic non-toxic compound, is excreted by the kidneys into the urine.
