<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During the reaction, one of the amino acids gives a carboxyl group to the reaction and loses a hydroxyl group (hydrogen and oxygen). The other amino acid loses hydrogen from the NH2 group. The hydroxyl group is substituted by nitrogen thus forming a peptide bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A peptide bond is a chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule; thereby, releasing a molecule of H2O. This is a dehydration synthesis reaction and usually occurs between amino acids and the resulting molecules is an amide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Peptide bond: A covalent bond joining the -amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of another with the loss of a water molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids are joined together by a peptide bond. The peptide bond is formed via dehydration synthesis when a hydroxyl is removed from amino acid 1 and a hydrogen is removed from amino acid 2 to form water as a byproduct. The resulting C-N bond is a peptide bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Peptide bonds are formed by a biochemical reaction that extracts a water molecule as it joins the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of a neighboring amino acid. The linear sequence of amino acids within a protein is considered the primary structure of the protein.
