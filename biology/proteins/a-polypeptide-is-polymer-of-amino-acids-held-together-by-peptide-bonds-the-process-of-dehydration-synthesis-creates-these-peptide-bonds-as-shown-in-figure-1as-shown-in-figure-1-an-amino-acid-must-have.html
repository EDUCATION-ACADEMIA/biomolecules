<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amino acids that are connected by a peptide bond are called a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide chain is composed of a sequence of amino acids dictated by the gene. A sequence of the amino acid chains provides diversity vital for meeting the demands of life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the formation of the bond shown in Figure 1 ? A covalent bond is formed between a carbon atom and a nitrogen atom along with the formation ofH2OH2O .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which feature of model 1 best illustrates how biological information is coded in a DNA molecule? Figure 1 represents a segment of DNA. Radiation can damage the nucleotides in a DNA molecule. To repair some types of damage, a single nucleotide can be removed from a DNA molecule and replaced with an undamaged nucleotide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct option is given by: A. A bond forms between the carboxyl functional amino acid and the amino functional group of the other amino acid.
