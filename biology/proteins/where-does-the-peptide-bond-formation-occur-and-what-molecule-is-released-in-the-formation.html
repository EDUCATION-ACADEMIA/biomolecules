<title>Where does the peptide bond formation occur and what molecule is released in the formation?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="A peptide bond is a chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, releasing a molecule of water H20. This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids.The peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit, where peptide bond synthesis occurs (1–4), has two major components: an A site, which interacts with the CCA end of aminoacylated tRNAs, and a P site, where the CCA ends of peptidyl tRNAs are bound when peptide bonds form (5–7).During the formation of this bond, there is a release of water (H2O) molecules. A peptide bond is usually a covalent bond (CO-NH bond) and since the water molecule is eliminated it is considered as a dehydration process. Generally, this process occurs mostly between amino groups.Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another through dehydration synthesis.Answer and Explanation: The amino acid acids are joined together by peptide bond to form short polymer chain called Peptide or long polymer chain called Protein. The peptide bond is formed between the amino group of one amino acid with carboxylic acid group of another amino group by eliminating water molecules.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A peptide bond is a chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, releasing a molecule of water H20. This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit, where peptide bond synthesis occurs (1–4), has two major components: an A site, which interacts with the CCA end of aminoacylated tRNAs, and a P site, where the CCA ends of peptidyl tRNAs are bound when peptide bonds form (5–7).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During the formation of this bond, there is a release of water (H2O) molecules. A peptide bond is usually a covalent bond (CO-NH bond) and since the water molecule is eliminated it is considered as a dehydration process. Generally, this process occurs mostly between amino groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another through dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The amino acid acids are joined together by peptide bond to form short polymer chain called Peptide or long polymer chain called Protein. The peptide bond is formed between the amino group of one amino acid with carboxylic acid group of another amino group by eliminating water molecules.
