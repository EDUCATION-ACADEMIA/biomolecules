<meta name="description" content="Complete answer: A prosthetic group of a protein is a non-protein component. It is a part of the structure of the hetero proteins or conjugated proteins, being covalently linked to the apoprotein. The prosthetic group is required for the proteins biological activity and is a component of a conjugated protein.Prosthetic groups are cofactors that bind tightly to proteins or enzymes. It is a specific non-polypeptide required for the biological function of some proteins. The prosthetic group may be organic (such as vitamin, sugar or lipid) or inorganic (such as metal ion), but is not composed of amino acids.A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that is bound to a protein and is required for the proteins biological activity. These proteins are commonly enzymes. Cofactors can be considered helper molecules that assist in biochemical transformations.A prosthetic group of a protein is a non-protein structure that is: permanently associated with the protein. When oxygen binds to a heme-containing protein, the two open coordination bonds of Fe2+ are occupied by: one O2 molecule and one amino acid atom.Hemoglobin consists of two pairs of different proteins, each protein is bound to a molecule of heme.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Complete answer: A prosthetic group of a protein is a non-protein component. It is a part of the structure of the hetero proteins or conjugated proteins, being covalently linked to the apoprotein. The prosthetic group is required for the protein’s biological activity and is a component of a conjugated protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Prosthetic groups are cofactors that bind tightly to proteins or enzymes. It is a specific non-polypeptide required for the biological function of some proteins. The prosthetic group may be organic (such as vitamin, sugar or lipid) or inorganic (such as metal ion), but is not composed of amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that is bound to a protein and is required for the protein’s biological activity. These proteins are commonly enzymes. Cofactors can be considered “helper molecules” that assist in biochemical transformations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A prosthetic group of a protein is a non-protein structure that is: permanently associated with the protein. When oxygen binds to a heme-containing protein, the two open coordination bonds of Fe2+ are occupied by: one O2 molecule and one amino acid atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hemoglobin consists of two pairs of different proteins, each protein is bound to a molecule of heme. The heme is known as a prosthetic group.
