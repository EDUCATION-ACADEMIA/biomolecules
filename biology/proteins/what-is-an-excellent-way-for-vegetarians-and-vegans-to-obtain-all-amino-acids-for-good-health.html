<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Without meat and dairy, you still need to consume essential amino acids. Vegans can get protein from nuts, peanut butter, seeds, grains, and legumes. Non-animal products like tofu and soymilk also provide protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To get the most out of a vegetarian diet, choose a variety of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains. At the same time, cut back on less healthy choices, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices and refined grains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If you’re on a vegetarian diet, you don’t need to worry about being unable to get your protein from animal sources. Eating a variety of vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds will supply all the amino acids you need to fulfill the protein requirements for good health.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Eat beans, pulses, eggs and other sources of protein Pulses are particularly important for people who don’t get protein by eating meat, fish or dairy products.
