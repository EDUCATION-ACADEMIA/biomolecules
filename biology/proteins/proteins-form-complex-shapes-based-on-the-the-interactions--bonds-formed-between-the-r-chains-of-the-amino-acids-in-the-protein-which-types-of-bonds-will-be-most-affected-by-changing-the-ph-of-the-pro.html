<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The tertiary structure is primarily due to interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The R group determines the characteristics (size, polarity, and pH) for each type of amino acid. Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another through dehydration synthesis. A chain of amino acids is a polypeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Within a protein, multiple amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, thereby forming a long chain. Peptide bonds are formed by a biochemical reaction that extracts a water molecule as it joins the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of a neighboring amino acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures such as the alpha helix.
