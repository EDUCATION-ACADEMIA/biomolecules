<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Foods derived from plants and animals can both provide protein, but there are some differences. Protein exists throughout the body, in everything from the muscles and organs to the bones, skin, and hair. The body does not store protein like it does other macronutrients, so this protein has to come from the diet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Animal protein, with its higher protein quality, is usually considered to be superior to plant protein for building muscle mass [15, 16, 17].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-According to Harvard Health Publishing, all animal-based foods, including meat, dairy, and eggs, contain complete protein. The majority of plant-based protein sources, such as whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts, spinach, broccoli, and mushrooms, are incomplete.
