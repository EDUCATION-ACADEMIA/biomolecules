<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is called its tertiary structure. The tertiary structure is primarily due to interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonds in a protein molecule. Large numbers of hydrogen bonds form between adjacent regions of the folded polypeptide chain and help stabilize its three-dimensional shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Protein tertiary structure is the three dimensional shape of a protein. The tertiary structure will have a single polypeptide chain “backbone” with one or more protein secondary structures, the protein domains. Amino acid side chains may interact and bond in a number of ways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Four interactions stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein: (a) ionic bonding, (b) hydrogen bonding, (c) disulfide linkages, and (d) dispersion forces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The chemistry of amino acid side chains is critical to protein structure because these side chains can bond with one another to hold a length of protein in a certain shape or conformation. Charged amino acid side chains can form ionic bonds, and polar amino acids are capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
