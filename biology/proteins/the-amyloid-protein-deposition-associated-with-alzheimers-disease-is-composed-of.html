</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Amyloid proteins are a group of proteins that share the common characteristic of the ability to form beta-pleated sheets, which are resistant to proteolysis. More than 20 different types of amyloid have been identified.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The beta-amyloid protein involved in Alzheimer’s comes in several different molecular forms that collect between neurons. It is formed from the breakdown of a larger protein, called amyloid precursor protein. One form, beta-amyloid 42, is thought to be especially toxic.
