<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-At the “center” of each amino acid is a carbon called the carbon and attached to it are four groups-a hydrogen, an -carboxyl group, an -amine group, and an R-group, sometimes referred to as a side chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The general structure of an amino acid is: Note the central carbon atom, to which 4 different groups are attached: an amino group (drawn by convention at the left), a carboxylic acid group (put at the right side), a hydrogen, and a side chain, or R-group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each amino acid has the same core structure, which consists of a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha () carbon, bonded to an amino group (NH2), a carboxyl group (COOH), and a hydrogen atom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There are basically four different classes of amino acids determined by different side chains: (1) non-polar and neutral, (2) polar and neutral, (3) acidic and polar, (4) basic and polar.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-There is also a hydrogen attached to the central carbon. The last substituent varies between amino acids and determines how the particular amino acid will be used in proteins. This variable group is known as the “R-group.” Only one amino acid, alanine, has a methyl group attached in the “R-group” position.
