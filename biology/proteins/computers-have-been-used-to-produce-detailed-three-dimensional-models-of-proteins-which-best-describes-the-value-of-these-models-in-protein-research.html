<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The three-dimensional structure of a protein is determined by techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Scientists who determine the structure of a proteins deposit their data into a database such as Protein Data Bank (PDB).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins need a 3-dimensional structure because they act as enzymes and building blocks for cells. Proteins serve an important function as the structural units of cells. Just like bricks have a specific shape to provide structure to our homes, proteins have a specific shape to provide structure for cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-PyMol is an open source, three dimensional visualization tool to view the macromolecular structures like proteins and nucleic acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The overall three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is called its tertiary structure. The tertiary structure is primarily due to interactions between the R groups of the amino acids that make up the protein.
