<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Both are larger compounds; nucleic acids are made of nucleotides while proteins are made of amino acids. Nucleic acids are larger compounds made of amino acids, while proteins are smaller subunits that make up amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Protein is a molecule made up of polypeptides. It is a class of biological molecule consisting of chains of amino acids called polypeptides. Nucleic acid is a class of macromolecules made up of long chain of polynucleotide that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), carry genetic information which is read in cells to make the RNA and proteins by which living things function. The well-known structure of the DNA double helix allows this information to be copied and passed on to the next generation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Nucleic acids are long chainlike molecules composed of a series of nearly identical building blocks called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogen-containing aromatic base attached to a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, which is in turn attached to a phosphate group.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The order of bases in the mRNA code determines the order in which amino acids are linked together in the ribosome. The resulting amino acid chains undergo further adjustments, such a folding, but the chain is the base structure of the protein. Therefore, the DNA code determines the base structure of proteins.
