<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Proteins and carbohydrates are alike in that provide structural support in cells (Option B). The building blocks of carbohydrates are monosaccharides that are held together by glycosidic bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, are the four major macromolecules. They perform important functions, including providing structural support, being a source of stored fuel, storing and retrieving genetic information, and speeding biochemical reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proteins are similar to carbohydrates and lipids in that they are polymers (simple repeating units); however, proteins are much more structurally complex. In contrast to carbohydrates, which have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids that are different from one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Proteins serve a variety of functions within cells. Some are involved in structural support and movement, others in enzymatic activity, and still others in interaction with the outside world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, fats and proteins belong to the class of macronutrients that your body requires in relatively large quantities to function optimally. They share the common characteristic of being organic compounds, a term which, in chemistry, simply describes a mixture of carbon and one or more elements.
