<title>Which protein has the highest tensile strength (ability to resist breaking when stretched)?

<meta name="description" content="Collagen is a particularly abundant fibrous protein that accounts for 25 per cent of all body protein.

Collagen is the most abundant (~ 30%) protein in the body, and the largest component of the ECM, where it serves an essential structural role as provider of tensile strength to tissues and organs. It also plays an important role in the elasticity of a limited number of tissues, especially in tendons [8].Proteins known as release factors bind to any ribosome with a stop codon positioned in the A site, and this binding forces the peptidyl transferase in the ribosome to catalyze the addition of a water molecule instead of an amino acid to the peptidyl-tRNA (Figure 6-73).Why is carbon so basic to life? The reason is carbons ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Collagen is a particularly abundant fibrous protein that accounts for 25 per cent of all body protein. It has high tensile strength and is found particularly in skin and tendons.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Collagen. Collagen is the most abundant (  30%) protein in the body, and the largest component of the ECM, where it serves an essential structural role as provider of tensile strength to tissues and organs. It also plays an important role in the elasticity of a limited number of tissues, especially in tendons [8].

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Why is carbon so basic to life? The reason is carbon’s ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules. In fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things!
