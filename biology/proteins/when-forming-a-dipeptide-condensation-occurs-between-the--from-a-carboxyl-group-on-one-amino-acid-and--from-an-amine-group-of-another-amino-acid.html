<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The −OH from the carboxyl group of one amino acid combines with a hydrogen atom from the amine group of the other amino acid to produce water (blue). This reaction forms a molecule called a dipeptide and the carbon-nitrogen covalent bond is called a peptide bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A peptide bond is a chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, releasing a molecule of water (H2O). This is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of amino acid 1, and amino group of amino acid 2. Water is removed as a byproduct. The resulting peptide bond is a C-N covalent bond that now links the two amino acids together, to form a dipeptide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A peptide bond is formed by a dehydration synthesis or reaction at a molecular level. This reaction is also known as a condensation reaction which usually occurs between amino acids. As depicted in the figure given below, two amino acids bond together to form a peptide bond by the dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another through dehydration synthesis.
