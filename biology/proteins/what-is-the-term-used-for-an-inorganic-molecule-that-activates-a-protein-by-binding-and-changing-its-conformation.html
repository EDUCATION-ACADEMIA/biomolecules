<strong> What is the term used for an inorganic molecule that activates a protein by binding and changing its conformation? 
</strong>
<p>(A) inhibitor 
</p>
<p>(B) enzyme protein 
</p>
<p>(C) ** cofactor 
</p>
<p>(D) coenzyme

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The protein part of the enzyme, which is inactive without the cofactor is called an apoenzyme. It binds to the cofactor, which may be metal ions, or a coenzyme, which are non-proteinaceous simple molecules such as NADH, FADH etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is required for an enzyme’s role as a catalyst (a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction). Cofactors can be considered “helper molecules” that assist in biochemical transformations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cofactors are inorganic ions that stabilize enzyme conformation and function. Coenzymes are organic molecules required for proper enzyme function and are often derived from vitamins. An enzyme lacking a cofactor or coenzyme is an apoenzyme; an enzyme with a bound cofactor or coenzyme is a holoenzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins They act as catalysts, which means that they make biochemical reactions happen faster than they would otherwise. Without enzymes, those reactions simply would not occur or would run too slowly to sustain life.
