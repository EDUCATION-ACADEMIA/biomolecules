The major secondary structures are α-helices and β-structures.Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain sometimes causes certain patterns of folding to occur.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The amino acid sequence is known as the primary structure of the protein. Stretches of polypeptide chain that form helices and sheets constitute the protein’s secondary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Secondary structure refers to regular, recurring arrangements in space of adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. It is maintained by hydrogen bonds between amide hydrogens and carbonyl oxygens of the peptide backbone. The major secondary structures are -helices and -structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain sometimes causes certain patterns of folding to occur. Known as alpha helices and beta sheets, these stable folding patterns make up the secondary structure of a protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Secondary structure refers to regular, local structure of the protein backbone, stabilised by intramolecular and sometimes intermolecular hydrogen bonding of amide groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Tertiary (3D) structure is a shape resulting from folding of secondary structures determined by interactions between side chains of amino acids. Quaternary structure describes the arrangement of the polypeptide chains in the multi subunit arrangement. This video shows the 4 levels of protein structure.
