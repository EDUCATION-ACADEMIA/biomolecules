<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During protein translation, the P-site holds the tRNA which is linked to the growing polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is reached, the peptidyl-tRNA bond of the tRNA located in the P-site is cleaved releasing the newly synthesized protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The initiator tRNA molecule, carrying the methionine amino acid that will serve as the first amino acid of the polypeptide chain, is bound to the P site on the ribosome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Peptidyl transferase is the activity responsible for peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. This enzyme activity catalyzes the reaction between the amino group of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site and the carboxyl carbon of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, forming a peptide bond from an ester bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The tRNA is located in the ribosome’s first docking site. This tRNA’s anticodon is complementary to the mRNA’s initiation codon, where translation starts. The tRNA carries the amino acid that corresponds to that codon. The next mRNA codon is now exposed in the ribosome’s other docking site.
