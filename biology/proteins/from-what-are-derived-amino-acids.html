<title>From what are derived amino acids?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Amino acids have four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions of the central carbon atom (alpha carbon). These are hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group designated as R group. So, amino acids are also known as substituted methanes because of the substituent groups.Amino acids are made from plant-derived ingredients. Fermented products such as miso and soy are made by fermenting soy or wheat with a koji culture. The fermentation process breaks down the protein and turns it into amino acids.Charged amino acid side chains can form ionic bonds, and polar amino acids are capable of forming hydrogen bonds.These are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Although your body can make nonessential amino acids, it cannot make essential amino acids, so you have to get them from your diet.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amino acids have four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions of the central carbon atom (alpha carbon). These are hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group designated as R group. So, amino acids are also known as substituted methanes because of the substituent groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Amino acids are made from plant-derived ingredients. Fermented products such as miso and soy are made by fermenting soy or wheat with a koji culture. The fermentation process breaks down the protein and turns it into amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Charged amino acid side chains can form ionic bonds, and polar amino acids are capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-These are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Although your body can make nonessential amino acids, it cannot make essential amino acids, so you have to get them from your diet.
