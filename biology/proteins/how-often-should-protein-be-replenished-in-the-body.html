<meta name="description" content="Protein is important because it provides the amino acids your body needs to build and repair muscle. Most research suggests very active people should eat 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.

That means that to stimulate muscle growth throughout the day, you should consume protein every four hours or so, he says.Considerations. Eating protein every two hours isnt necessarily a bad idea. If you can include healthy carbohydrates and fats in your diet, evenly distribute your proteins throughout the day and stick to small serving sizes, you can space out your meals however you want.The maximum rate that a fast absorbing protein like whey can be absorbed is about 8-10 grams per hour. That means you need to space out your protein intake throughout the entire day-you wont be able to eat and properly absorb your daily requirement for protein in just one sitting.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Protein is important because it provides the amino acids your body needs to build and repair muscle. Most research suggests very active people should eat 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That means a 150-pound person should eat 82 to 136 grams each day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-protein must be replenished daily-this is important for replacing worn out body tissues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Your body uses the nutrients from your meal or snack to build muscle for somewhere around four to five hours, says Brad Schoenfeld, assistant professor in exercise science at Lehman College. “That means that to stimulate muscle growth throughout the day, you should consume protein every four hours or so, ” he says.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Considerations. Eating protein every two hours isn’t necessarily a bad idea. If you can include healthy carbohydrates and fats in your diet, evenly distribute your proteins throughout the day and stick to small serving sizes, you can space out your meals however you want.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The maximum rate that a fast absorbing protein like whey can be absorbed is about 8-10 grams per hour. That means you need to space out your protein intake throughout the entire day-you won’t be able to eat and properly absorb your daily requirement for protein in just one sitting.
