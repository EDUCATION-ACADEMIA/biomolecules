<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In other words, hydrolysis is a chemical reaction which splits a molecule into smaller units by the addition of water molecules. For example hydrolysis of polymers results in the formation of monomer units as it splits the connections between monomer units.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The breakdown of large molecules by enzymes, through the addition of water is called a hydrolysis reaction. This type of reaction breaks down large polymers (such as proteins) into smaller fragments through breaking of the bonds.
