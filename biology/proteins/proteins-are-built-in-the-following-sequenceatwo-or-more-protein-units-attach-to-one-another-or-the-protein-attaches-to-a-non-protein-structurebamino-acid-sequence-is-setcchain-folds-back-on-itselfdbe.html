<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Within a protein, multiple amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, thereby forming a long chain. Peptide bonds are formed by a biochemical reaction that extracts a water molecule as it joins the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of a neighboring amino acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The sequence in which amino acids are arranged in a protein is called primary structure. The linear sequence of amino acids constitutes a protein’s primary structure. The sequence is written from the amino-terminal end (the first amino acid) to the carboxyl-terminal end.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Quaternary Structure of Protein Some of the proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains referred to as sub-units. The spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quaternary structure.
