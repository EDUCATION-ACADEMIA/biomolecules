<title>A protein molecule made from two amino acids
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Peptide bonds are formed as two amino acids are joined together to form a protein. Peptide bonds form through a process called dehydration synthesis (polymerization). Polymerization is a process in which monomers are joined together to form polymers. A water molecule is formed as a byproduct.A peptide bond is the amide bond that occurs between the amine nitrogen of one amino acid and the carboxyl carbon of another amino acid. The resulting molecule is called a dipeptide.Peptides are generally considered to be short chains of two or more amino acids. Meanwhile, proteins are long molecules made up of multiple peptide subunits, and are also known as polypeptides.Answer and Explanation: When two amino acids join together, they form a dipeptide. These two amino acids are linked by a peptide bond. A string of many peptides is called a polypeptide.Dipeptides are produced from polypeptides by the action of the hydrolase enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase. Dietary proteins are digested to dipeptides and amino acids, and the dipeptides are absorbed more rapidly than the amino acids, because their uptake involves a separate mechanism.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Peptide bonds are formed as two amino acids are joined together to form a protein. Peptide bonds form through a process called dehydration synthesis (polymerization). Polymerization is a process in which monomers are joined together to form polymers. A water molecule is formed as a byproduct.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Peptides are generally considered to be short chains of two or more amino acids. Meanwhile, proteins are long molecules made up of multiple peptide subunits, and are also known as polypeptides.
