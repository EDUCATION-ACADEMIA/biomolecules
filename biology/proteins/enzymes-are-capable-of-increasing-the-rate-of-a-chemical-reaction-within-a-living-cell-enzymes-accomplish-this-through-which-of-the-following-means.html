<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example: Enzymes bring reactants together so they donâ€™t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This minimum energy required for the reaction to proceed is called the activation energy. Enzymes enhance the rate of the reaction by reducing the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed.
