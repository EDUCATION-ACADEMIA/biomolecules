<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Quaternary structure refers only to proteins that are composed of multiple polypeptides. These separate polypeptides are held together by the same intermolecular forces found in secondary and tertiary structures. In addition, disulfide bonds are also found in quaternary structure, just like in tertiary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Quaternary structure exists in proteins consisting of two or more identical or different polypeptide chains (subunits). These proteins are called oligomers because they have two or more subunits. The quaternary structure describes the manner in which subunits are arranged in the native protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The correct answer is option (C) Maybe either alpha or beta and depends on the primary structure of subunits. Note: Proteins consisting of two or more similar or various polypeptide chains (subunits) occur in proteins. Since they have two or more subunits, these proteins are called oligomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Many proteins are made up of a single polypeptide chain and have only three levels of structure (the ones weâ€™ve just discussed). However, some proteins are made up of multiple polypeptide chains, also known as subunits. When these subunits come together, they give the protein its quaternary structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The quaternary structure of a protein is the association of several protein chains or subunits into a closely packed arrangement. Each of the subunits has its own primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. The subunits are held together by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between nonpolar side chains.
