<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The CFTR protein is made up of 1, 480 amino acids linked together in a chain. Some humans produce a version of the CFTR protein in which phenylalanine (an amino acid) has been deleted from position 508 of the amino acid chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The CFTR protein is composed of 1, 480 amino acids-the building blocks of all proteins-and is located on the surface of many cells in the body. The CFTR protein contains a single chain of amino acids that are grouped in five functional regions called domains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cystic fibrosis The most common mutation, called delta F508, is a deletion of one amino acid at position 508 in the CFTR protein. The resulting abnormal channel breaks down shortly after it is made, so it never reaches the cell membrane to transport chloride ions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When the CFTR protein is made using all of the correct amino acids, it forms a stable 3-D shape. It has to be the right shape to transport chloride. When a mutation causes an amino acid to be deleted or an incorrect amino acid to be added, the CFTR protein cannot form its correct 3-D shape and function properly.
