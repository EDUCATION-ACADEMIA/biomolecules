<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The function of a protein is determined by its shape. The shape of a protein is determined by its primary structure (sequence of amino acids). The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene (DNA) encoding it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Protein function is directly related to the structure of that protein. A proteinâ€™s specific shape determines its function. If the three-dimensional structure of the protein is altered because of a change in the structure of the amino acids, the protein becomes denatured and does not perform its function as expected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The shape of a protein is solely determined by the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain.
