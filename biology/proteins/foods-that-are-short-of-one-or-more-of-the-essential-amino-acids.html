<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If the protein you eat doesn’t have all the nine types of amino acids you need to get from food, it’s called an “incomplete protein.” Incomplete proteins examples include: Nuts and seeds. ‌Whole grains (like brown rice or whole-wheat bread) ‌Vegetables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Plant foods are considered incomplete proteins because they are low or lacking in one or more of the amino acids we need to build cells. Incomplete proteins found in plant foods can be mixed together to make a complete protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-They are called incomplete proteins. Incomplete proteins lack one or more essential amino acids but will neither support growth or provide normal maintenance of body tissues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The majority of plant-based protein sources, such as whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts, spinach, broccoli, and mushrooms, are incomplete.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An incomplete protein is one that does not contain all nine of those essential amino acids. Beans, specific nuts, and tofu are a couple examples of incomplete protein sources, so eating those foods alone for protein will not give you all of the amino acids your body needs.
