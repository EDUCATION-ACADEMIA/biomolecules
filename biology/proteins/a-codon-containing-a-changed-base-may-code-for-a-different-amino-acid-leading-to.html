<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A mutation causing the complete disruption of the function of the protein is called as null mutation. A point mutation that changes a codon specifying a different amino acid is called as missence mutation. Option C is correct answer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The bases in DNA and RNA have a sequence which dictates the sequence of amino acids, so any alteration of the sequence of bases in DNA can potentially alter the structure of proteins for which they code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Missense Mutation A missense mutation is a DNA change that results in different amino acids being encoded at a particular position in the resulting protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Missense mutations occur when a single nucleotide base in a DNA sequence is swapped for another one, resulting in a different codon and, therefore, a different amino acid. These mutations are quite common and, in most cases, they donâ€™t affect the overall shape and function of the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Missense: A missense variant is a type of substitution in which the nucleotide change results in the replacement of one protein building block (amino acid) with another in the protein made from the gene. The amino acid change may alter the function of the protein.
