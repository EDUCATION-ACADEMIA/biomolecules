<title>What happens at physiological pH (7, 4)?

Thus when the pH is maintained at 7, carboxylic acids are ionized.Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO−. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed.-The pKa of the carboxyl group is always lower than that of the amino group hence when pH increases, the carboxyl group will be deprotonated before the amino group.-The pKb values for amino groups are lower than that of carboxyl groups, hence the amino groups will be protonated before the carboxyl groups.At high pH, both the carboxyl and amine groups are deprotonated. At these pH values, the amino acid carries a net negative charge, and is dibasic. At some intermediate pH, the amino acid is a zwitterions, and carries no net charge. This is called the isoelectric point of the amino acids, and is designated pHI.">

<strong> What happens at physiological pH (7, 4)? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Most of the carboxyl groups are dissociated and most of the amino groups bind O2 
</p>
<p>(B) Most of the carboxyl groups are dissociated 
</p>
<p>(C) Most of the carboxyl groups are dissociated create anion NH3- 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Most of the carboxyl groups are dissociated, create anion COO-and most of the amino groups bind H+ creating cation-NH3+

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If an acid with a pKa lower than 7 (like a carboxylic acid, pKa   5) is dissolved in such a solution, it is the stronger acid and will transfer a proton to the solution and become the carboxylate ion. Thus when the pH is maintained at 7, carboxylic acids are ionized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO−. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>–The pKa of the carboxyl group is always lower than that of the amino group hence when pH increases, the carboxyl group will be deprotonated before the amino group.-The pKb values for amino groups are lower than that of carboxyl groups, hence the amino groups will be protonated before the carboxyl groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-At high pH, both the carboxyl and amine groups are deprotonated. At these pH values, the amino acid carries a net negative charge, and is dibasic. At some intermediate pH, the amino acid is a zwitterions, and carries no net charge. This is called the isoelectric point of the amino acids, and is designated pHI.
