<title>Which statement about enzymes is FALSE?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The correct answer: The statement that is false about the enzymes d. A specific enzyme can catalyze a variety of chemical reactions. The enzymes are basically proteins that are produced from the secretory cells.Enzymes are biological catalysts which speed up biochemical reactions. According to the most widely accepted theory, enzymes bind to the substrate molecule and form a transition state. During the progress of a reaction the substrates are separated from products by an energy barrier which the substrates need to cross.There are thousands of individual enzymes in the body. Each type of enzyme only has one job. For example, the enzyme sucrase breaks down a sugar called sucrose. Lactase breaks down lactose, a kind of sugar found in milk products.This statement about enzymes is true: Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are proteins whose three-dimensional form is key to their function. Enzymes do not alter the overall change in free energy for a reaction.Enzymes only catalyse the reaction but they are not involved in the reaction.">
