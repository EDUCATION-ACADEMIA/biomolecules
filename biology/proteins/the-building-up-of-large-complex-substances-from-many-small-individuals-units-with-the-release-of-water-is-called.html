<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means “to put together while losing water.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis reactions are combination or synthesis reactions which occur between the same or different monomer units with the elimination of water molecules. It is a kind of condensation reaction in which water molecules are eliminated with the addition of two molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis is the creation of larger molecules from smaller monomers where a water molecule is released. This can be used in the creation of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the creation of large biological molecules such as carbohydrate polymers and triglycerides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Dehydration synthesis reactions build molecules up and generally require energy, while hydrolysis reactions break molecules down and generally release energy. Carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are built up and broken down via these types of reactions, although the monomers involved are different in each case.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Since a water molecule is released to form a peptide bond, the process is referred to as dehydration synthesis. This process continues during translation as amino acids join continuously to the preceding one by peptide bonds, forming a polypeptide chain.
