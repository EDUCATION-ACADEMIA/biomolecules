<strong> Cells can produce over one thousand different enzymes at a time. Enzymes are critical to the metabolism of these cells, but why are so many different enzymes needed? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Cells are completely unable to control what enzymes they produce 
</p>
<p>(B) The variety of enzymes prevents their actions from being inhibited. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The active site of an enzyme can only bind to a specific substrate. 
</p>
<p>(D) The products of a reaction are always converted into new enzymes.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cells can produce over one thousand different enzymes at a time. Enzymes are critical to the metabolism of these cells, but why are so many different enzymes needed? The variety of enzymes prevents their actions from being inhibited. The active site of an enzyme can only bind to a specific substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Since most reactions in your body’s cells need special enzymes, each cell contains thousands of different enzymes. Enzymes let chemical reactions in the body happen millions of times faster than without the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cells contain thousands of different enzymes, and their activities determine which of the many possible chemical reactions actually take place within the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes help facilitate biochemical reactions in our bodies. They aid in everything from breathing to digestion. Having too little or too much of a certain enzyme can lead to health problems. Some people with chronic conditions may need to take enzyme supplements to help their bodies work as they should.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again.
