<title>Which of the following best explains why enzymes are necessary for many cellular reactions?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer: D-The reactions are too slow to meet the needs of the cell if enzymes are missing. Most commonly, enzymes accelerate biochemical reactions by lowering the amount of activation energy required.First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.Which of the following best describes the action of an enzyme? Explanation: Enzymes are biological molecules that help catalyze reactions by lowering the energy of activation and increasing the rate of a reaction.The correct answer is A. Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction. Enzymes are biological catalysts that are known to lower the activation energy of reactions to allow the reaction rate to increase.It is important to remember that enzymes do not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the free energy of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go forward (Figure 1).">
