<title>How does an enzymes shape relate to its function?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The shape of an enzyme is very important because it has a direct effect on how it catalyzes a reaction. An enzymes shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids in its structure, and the bonds which form between the atoms of those molecules.The enzyme recognizes the shape of its substrate and it is able to hold it in position in what is called the active site. The active site is the part of the enzyme that binds the substrate and carries out the reaction. Enzyme specificity means that the enzyme only binds certain molecules that have the right shape.It was thought that the shape of an enzyme fitted that of the substrate, rather like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle fitting together.

<strong> How does an enzymes shape relate to its function? 
</strong>
<p>(A) the shape of the enzyme has no relation to its function 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the enzyme is shaped specially for certain substrates to perform a specific reaction 
</p>
<p>(C) the enzyme shape acts as a receptor to certain products 
</p>
<p>(D) the enzyme shape can fit into specific substrates to cease a reaction 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The shape of an enzyme is very important because it has a direct effect on how it catalyzes a reaction. An enzyme’s shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids in its structure, and the bonds which form between the atoms of those molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The enzyme recognizes the shape of its substrate and it is able to hold it in position in what is called the active site. The active site is the part of the enzyme that binds the substrate and carries out the reaction. Enzyme specificity means that the enzyme only binds certain molecules that have the right shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It was thought that the shape of an enzyme fitted that of the substrate, rather like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle fitting together. This is known as the “lock and key” model.
