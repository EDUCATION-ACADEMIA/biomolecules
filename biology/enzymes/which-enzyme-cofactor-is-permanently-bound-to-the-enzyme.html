<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Coenzymes are further divided into two types. The first is called a “prosthetic group", which consists of a coenzyme that is tightly (or even covalently) and permanently bound to a protein. The second type of coenzymes are called “cosubstrates", and are transiently bound to the protein.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cofactors can be classed as “prosthetic groups” or “coenzymes” depending on how tightly they are bound to the enzyme; coenzymes bind more loosely to the enzyme, and are thus modified during the enzymatic reaction, while prosthetic groups are more tightly bound to the enzyme and are not modified.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Prosthetic groups are cofactors that bind tightly to proteins or enzymes. As if holding on for dear life, they are not easily removed. They can be organic or metal ions and are often attached to proteins by a covalent bond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-They can bind tightly or loosely to an enzyme. Coenzymes that are tightly bound are known as prosthetic groups, whilst loosely bound coenzymes are called cosubstrates. This is because they actually bind and are released from the enzyme, much like a substrate molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-It is the cofactor for the enzyme and does not form a permanent part in the enzyme’s structure. Sometimes, they are called cosubstrates and are considered substrates that are loosely bound to the enzyme.
