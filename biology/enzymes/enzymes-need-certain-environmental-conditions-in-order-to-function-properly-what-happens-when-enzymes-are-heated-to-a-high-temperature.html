<title>Enzymes need certain environmental conditions in order to function properly. What happens when enzymes are heated to a high temperature?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity.High heat destroys enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.If the shape of the active site is altered by a temperature change, the substrate can no longer bind and the enzyme is rendered ineffective. Thus, changes in environmental conditions can stop the enzyme from functioning effectively, or at all, by denaturing it.Enzyme activity is subject to influences of the local environment. In a cold environment, enzymes function more slowly because the molecules are moving more slowly. The substrate bumps into the enzyme less frequently. As the temperature increases, molecules move more quickly, so the enzyme functions at a higher rate.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-High heat destroys enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If the shape of the active site is altered by a temperature change, the substrate can no longer bind and the enzyme is rendered ineffective. Thus, changes in environmental conditions can stop the enzyme from functioning effectively, or at all, by denaturing it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzyme activity is subject to influences of the local environment. In a cold environment, enzymes function more slowly because the molecules are moving more slowly. The substrate bumps into the enzyme less frequently. As the temperature increases, molecules move more quickly, so the enzyme functions at a higher rate.
