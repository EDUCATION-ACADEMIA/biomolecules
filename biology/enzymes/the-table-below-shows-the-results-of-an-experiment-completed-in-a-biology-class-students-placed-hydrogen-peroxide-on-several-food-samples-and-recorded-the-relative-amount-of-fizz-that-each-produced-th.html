<strong> The table below shows the results of an experiment completed in a biology class.

</strong>
<p>(A) ** Raw liver produced the most oxygen bubbles, followed by raw potato. The catalase enzyme was fully functional and allowed the reaction to occur quickly. 
</p>
<p>(B) Plant cells produce more oxygen bubbles than animal cells because plant cells contain more protein, and therefore, more enzymes. 
</p>
<p>(C) Boiled potato and cooked liver produced the most oxygen bubbles. The catalase enzyme was denatured and allowed the reaction to occur quickly. 
</p>
<p>(D) Cooking the foods seems to increase the activity of the catalase enzyme because it speeds up the rate at which the enzyme is able to function.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When hydrogen peroxide comes in contact with the cut, it reacts with the catalase enzyme in the damaged cells to produce oxygen foam. When the catalase reaction is conducted in a test-tube, the oxygen gas bubbles. The height of the foam is an indication of the amount of catalase activity present.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fresh potato shows an interesting chemical activity. When dipped in a solution of hydrogen peroxide, it triggers bubbling of oxygen. This activity is due to a special protein produced by the potato to protect itself against oxidative stress.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Catalase breaks down two hydrogen peroxide molecules into one molecule of oxygen [9] and two molecules of water in a two-step reaction [10].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This enzyme detoxifies hydrogen peroxide by breaking it down into water and oxygen gas. The bubbles resulting from production of oxygen gas clearly indicate a catalase positive result.
