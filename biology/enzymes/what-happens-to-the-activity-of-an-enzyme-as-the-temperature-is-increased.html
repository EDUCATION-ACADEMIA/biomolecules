<title>What happens to the activity of an enzyme as the temperature is increased?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="As the temperature rises, so does the level of enzyme activity. Maximum activity is achieved at the enzymes optimum temperature. The active site of the enzyme changes shape as the temperature rises above optimum temperature, resulting in a decline in activity.Factors affecting enzyme activity Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range.The optimum temperature in most enzymes is around 37 degrees Celsius. When the temperature increases, however, the enzymatic activity decreases. This is because higher temperatures tend to denature proteins, which in turn causes them to lose their functionality. When a protein denatures, its shaped is altered.Lower temperatures lead to slower chemical reactions. Enzymes will eventually become inactive at freezing temperatures but will restore most of their enzyme activity when temperatures increase again, while some enzymes lose their activity when frozen.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As the temperature rises, so does the level of enzyme activity. Maximum activity is achieved at the enzymeâ€™s optimum temperature. The active site of the enzyme changes shape as the temperature rises above optimum temperature, resulting in a decline in activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Factors affecting enzyme activity Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The optimum temperature in most enzymes is around 37 degrees Celsius. When the temperature increases, however, the enzymatic activity decreases. This is because higher temperatures tend to denature proteins, which in turn causes them to lose their functionality. When a protein denatures, its shaped is altered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Lower temperatures lead to slower chemical reactions. Enzymes will eventually become inactive at freezing temperatures but will restore most of their enzyme activity when temperatures increase again, while some enzymes lose their activity when frozen.
