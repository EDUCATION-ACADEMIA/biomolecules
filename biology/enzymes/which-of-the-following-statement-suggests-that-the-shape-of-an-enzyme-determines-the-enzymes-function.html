<strong> Which of the following statement suggests that the shape of an enzyme determines the enzyme’s function? 
</strong>
<p>(A) enzymes can operate in a wide range of conditions 
</p>
<p>(B) ** enzymes are specific to a substrate 
</p>
<p>(C) enzymes are activated by neighboring molecules

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The statement that suggests that the shape of an enzyme determines its function, would be the fact that enzymes are specific to certain substrates, depending on the particular shape of an enzyme it can allow binding to specific substrates and allow for catalyzing that corresponding reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The first model called the lock and key model, proposes that the shape and chemistry of the substrate are complementary to the shape and chemistry of the active site on the enzyme. This means when the substrate enters the active site, it fits perfectly, and the two binds together, forming the enzyme-substrate complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The shape of an enzyme’s active site is complementary to the shape of its specific substrate or substrates. This means they can fit together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The correct answer is a. An enzyme’s function depends on its three-dimensional shape. An enzyme is a biocatalyst that is composed of protein or ribonucleic acid (RNA). An enzyme increases the rate of a biochemical reaction by lowering the level of activation energy that is required in the reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In an enzyme activity, the substrate must bind with the enzyme to become a catalyst of a chemical reaction. And most enzymes are highly specific particularly to the nature of the substrate they bind to.
