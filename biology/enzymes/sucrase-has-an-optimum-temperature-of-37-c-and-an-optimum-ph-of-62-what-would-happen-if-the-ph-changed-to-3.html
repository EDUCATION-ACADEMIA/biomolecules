<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This optimal temperature is usually around human body temperature (37.5 oC) for the enzymes in human cells. Above this temperature the enzyme structure begins to break down (denature) since at higher temperatures intra-and intermolecular bonds are broken as the enzyme molecules gain even more kinetic energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Changing the pH will affect the charges on the amino acid molecules. Amino acids that attracted each other may no longer be. Again, the shape of the enzyme, along with its active site, will change. Extremes of pH also denature enzymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Factors affecting enzyme activity However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working. pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity. Extreme pH values can cause enzymes to denature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The highly specific activity of intracellular sucrase towards sucrose is optimal at pH 6.0 and at 30°C.
