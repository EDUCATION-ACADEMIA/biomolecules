<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The active site of an enzyme is the part of the enzyme where substrate molecules bind and a chemical reaction takes place. The active site is made up of amino acid residues that establish temporary bonds with the substrate (binding site) as well as residues that catalyse that substrate’s reaction (catalytic site).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In biology and biochemistry, the active site is the region of an enzyme where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The active site is a groove or crevice on an enzyme in which a substrate binds to facilitate the catalyzed chemical reaction. Enzymes are typically specific because the conformation of amino acids in the active site stabilizes the specific binding of the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The specific action of an enzyme with a single substrate can be explained using a Lock and Key analogy first postulated in 1894 by Emil Fischer. In this analogy, the lock is the enzyme and the key is the substrate. Only the correctly sized key (substrate) fits into the key hole (active site) of the lock (enzyme).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The lock-and-key theory of enzyme action proposes that the enzyme’s active site and the shape of the substrate molecule are complementary to one another. This allows the substrate to fit into the enzyme, like how a key would fit into a lock. If the substrate doesn’t fit, then the enzyme will not act on it.
