<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy required for the reactants to come together and react. Activation energy refers to the energy that is needed to trigger a chemical reaction between two or more reactants.
