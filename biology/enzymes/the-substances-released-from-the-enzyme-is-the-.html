<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A substrate enters the active site of the enzyme. This forms the enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In order for a product molecule to be generated, a substrate molecule must first bind to the active site of an enzyme and be transformed into a product molecule. An example of a product molecule produced by an enzyme is phosphoenolpyruvate produced by the enzyme enolase.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.
