<strong> Which statement about the optimum pH for an enzyme is correct? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** It is the pH at which the enzymeâ€™s activity is greatest with the maximum number of enzyme-substrate complexes being formed 
</p>
<p>(B) It is the same for all enzymes 
</p>
<p>(C) It is the pH at which the enzyme cannot be damaged by heat

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer: The optimum pH for an enzyme is d) Where it works best. Optimum pH for an enzyme is the specific pH at which the enzyme can work the best.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are affected by changes in pH. The most favorable pH value-the point where the enzyme is most active-is known as the optimum pH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As the temperature is increased enzyme activity increases to a maximum value at the optimum temperature (around 37 oC for most human enzymes).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes function at an optimal pH where the highest activity can be observed. Outside this pH value, the activity of the enzyme decreases, and the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction slows down.
