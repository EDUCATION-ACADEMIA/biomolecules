<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins comprised of amino acids linked together in one or more polypeptide chains. This sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is called the primary structure. This, in turn, determines the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including the shape of the active site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are mainly globular proteins-protein molecules where the tertiary structure has given the molecule a generally rounded, ball shape (although perhaps a very squashed ball in some cases). The other type of proteins (fibrous proteins) have long thin structures and are found in tissues like muscle and hair.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins, and they make a biochemical reaction more likely to proceed by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, thereby making these reactions proceed thousands or even millions of times faster than they would without a catalyst.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The enzyme pepsin, for example, is a critical component of gastric juices, helping to break down food particles in the stomach. Likewise, the enzyme amylase, which is present in saliva, converts starch into sugar, helping to initiate digestion. In medicine, the enzyme thrombin is used to promote wound healing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Only few proteins have the capability to bind the substrate with the help of their active sites in such a manner that allows the reaction to take place in an efficient manner. Hence, all enzymes are proteins but all proteins are not enzymes.
