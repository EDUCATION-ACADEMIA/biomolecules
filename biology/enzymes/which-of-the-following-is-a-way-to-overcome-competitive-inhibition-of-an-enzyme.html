<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Increasing the pH or decreasing the temperature will have a negligible effect on the process of inhibition. The best solution is to increase the substrate concentration, so that there are more substrate molecules vying for the enzyme sites.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Competitive inhibition can be overcome by adding more substrate to the reaction, which increases the chances of the enzyme and substrate binding. As a result, competitive inhibition alters only the Km, leaving the Vmax the same.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Competitive inhibition can be reversed by increasing the substrate concentration. If the substrate predominates in the mixture, it will tend to displace the inhibitor bound to the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Competitive Inhibitors Note that since the inhibitor and substrate bind at the same site, competitive inhibition can be overcome simply by raising the substrate concentration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-This prevents the enzyme-substrate reaction from happening, thereby decreasing the activity of enzymes; however, competitive inhibitors can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrates. Increase in the amount of substrates will displace the inhibitors from the active site and allow for substrates to bind.
