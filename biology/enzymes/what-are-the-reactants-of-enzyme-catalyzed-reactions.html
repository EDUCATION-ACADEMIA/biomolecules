<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The reactant in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called the substrate. Enzymes are very specific as to which substrates they bind to, as well as which reactions they catalyze.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Key Terms. substrate: A reactant in a chemical reaction is called a substrate when acted upon by an enzyme. induced fit: Proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-To catalyze a reaction, an enzyme will grab on (bind) to one or more reactant molecules. These molecules are the enzyme’s substrates. In some reactions, one substrate is broken down into multiple products. In others, two substrates come together to create one larger molecule or to swap pieces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The ability of enzymes to catalyze reactions depends on their ability to interact directly and specifically with reactants The reactant of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is termed the substrate. An enzyme forms an enzyme-substrate complex as the initial step of its mechanism.
