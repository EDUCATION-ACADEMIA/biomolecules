<title>what happens to an enzyme when it goes under hot temperature?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.If the heat gets too intense then the enzymes literally shake themselves out of shape. The enzyme is said to be denatured. Enzymes generally become denatured when heated above 40�C. The optimum temperature for enzymes to work at is around 37�C which is why this temperature is body temperature.In a cold environment, enzymes function more slowly because the molecules are moving more slowly. The substrate bumps into the enzyme less frequently. As the temperature increases, molecules move more quickly, so the enzyme functions at a higher rate.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Denaturation of enzymes causes bonds to be broken, structure to be disrupted and it stops functioning. This happens to enzymes when they are exposed to extreme, unsuitable conditions, for instance, high temperatures or extreme pH levels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If the heat gets too intense then the enzymes literally shake themselves out of shape. The enzyme is said to be denatured. Enzymes generally become denatured when heated above 40C. The optimum temperature for enzymes to work at is around 37C which is why this temperature is body temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In a cold environment, enzymes function more slowly because the molecules are moving more slowly. The substrate bumps into the enzyme less frequently. As the temperature increases, molecules move more quickly, so the enzyme functions at a higher rate.
