<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-substrate: A reactant in a chemical reaction is called a substrate when acted upon by an enzyme. induced fit: Proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In biochemistry, the substrate is a molecule upon which an enzyme acts. Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions involving the substrate(s). In the case of a single substrate, the substrate bonds with the enzyme active site, and an enzyme-substrate complex is formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When an enzyme binds its substrate, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression by providing certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Catalytic Activity of Enzymes First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The reactant in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called a substrate.
