<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Competitive inhibition is demonstrated by malonate’s inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase. Competitive inhibitors have a structure that is similar to that of the substrate and bind to the active site, inhibiting enzyme activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Malonate is a three-carbon dicarboxylic acid. It is well known as a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. It occurs naturally in biological systems, such as legumes and developing rat brains, which indicates that it may play an important role in symbiotic nitrogen metabolism and brain development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Examples of competitive inhibition include the inhibition of trypsin by -1-antitrypsin, chymotrypsin by -1-antichymotrypsin, dihydrofolate reductase by the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate, and the Krebs cycle enzyme succinic dehydrogenase by malonate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One common example of competitive inhibition is inhibition of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase by malonate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Malonate is a reversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenase plays a central role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and as part of complex II of the electron transport chain.
