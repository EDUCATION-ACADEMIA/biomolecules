<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The answer is enzymes. Enzymes in our bodies are catalysts that speed up reactions by helping to lower the activation energy needed to start a reaction. Each enzyme molecule has a special place called the active site where another molecule, called the substrate, fits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes perform the critical task of lowering a reactionâ€™s activation energy-that is, the amount of energy that must be put in for the reaction to begin. Enzymes work by binding to reactant molecules and holding them in such a way that the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Desolvation or taking reactants out of the solution state. Establishing weak bonds between the reactants and enzyme. Bringing the reactant molecules closer in the region of the active sites of enzymes. Development of strain in the bonds of the reactants by the electrophilic and nucleophilic attack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes include detoxification, muscle building, and breaking down food particles during digestion. Enzymes actually accelerate the rate of a chemical reaction to support life. Enzymes are very helpful in performing important functions of our body.
