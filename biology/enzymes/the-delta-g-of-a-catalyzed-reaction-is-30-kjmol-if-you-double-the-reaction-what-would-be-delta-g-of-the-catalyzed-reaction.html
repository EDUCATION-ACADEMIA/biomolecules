<title>The delta G of a catalyzed reaction is 30 kJ/mol. If you double the reaction, what would be delta G of the catalyzed reaction?

<meta name="description" content="An increase in the amount of enzyme will increase the rate of the reaction (provided sufficient substrate is present).Which of the following will change the ∆G° of an enzyme catalyzed reaction? Increasing temperature will change the ∆G of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.Answer and Explanation: If you double the amount of enzyme present, the delta G of a reaction will not change. Enzymes are specialized types of proteins used to catalyze or speed up chemical reactions. Although they increase the overall rate of the reaction, they do not affect the net energy change.Enzymes lower ΔG‡ by allowing reactions to proceed via an alternate reaction mechanism that has a lower ΔG‡ than the uncatalyzed reaction. The substrates and products, and therefore their free energy values, are the same for both the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions, thus ΔG°rxn is the same for both reactions.">
