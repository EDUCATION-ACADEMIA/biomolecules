<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: Of the following regarding enzymes, enzymes being consumed by the reaction they catalyze is incorrect. Enzymes are special in that theyre able to catalyze many different reactions without being consumed or used up by the specific reaction.Answer is (1) Enzymes are non-specific for a reaction and substrate.Answer and Explanation: Enzymes are not destroyed during chemical reactions, as this is part of the definition of a catalyst, and enables them to catalyze many different reactions continuously as long as theres sufficient amount of substrate. All other statements are true about catalysts.Answer and Explanation: The answer is A. Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reaction by lowering activation energy barriers. Enzymes are biological catalysts.This statement about enzymes is true: Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are proteins whose three-dimensional form is key to their function. Enzymes do not alter the overall change in free energy for a reaction.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Of the following regarding enzymes, enzymes being consumed by the reaction they catalyze is incorrect. Enzymes are special in that they’re able to catalyze many different reactions without being consumed or used up by the specific reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer is (1) Enzymes are non-specific for a reaction and substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Enzymes are not destroyed during chemical reactions, as this is part of the definition of a catalyst, and enables them to catalyze many different reactions continuously as long as there’s sufficient amount of substrate. All other statements are true about catalysts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The answer is A. Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reaction by lowering activation energy barriers. Enzymes are biological catalysts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-This statement about enzymes is true: Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are proteins whose three-dimensional form is key to their function. Enzymes do not alter the overall change in free energy for a reaction.
