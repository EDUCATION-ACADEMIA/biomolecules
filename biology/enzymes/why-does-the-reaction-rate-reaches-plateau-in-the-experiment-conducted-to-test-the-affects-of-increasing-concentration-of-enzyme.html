<strong> Why does the reaction rate reaches plateau in the experiment conducted to test the affects of increasing concentration of enzyme? 
</strong>
<p>(A) time 
</p>
<p>(B) ** limited by substrate amount 
</p>
<p>(C) enzymes are denatured

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This plateau occurs because the enzyme is saturated, meaning that all available enzyme molecules are already tied up processing substrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-At high substrate concentration, the reaction rate reaches a plateau as the enzyme active sites become saturated with substrate (ES complex), and no free enzyme to bind the added substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-But as the substrate concentration climbs, the reaction rate begins to increase less and less until it comes to a point where it plateaus into a flat line. The reason this happens is because the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Initially, an increase in substrate concentration leads to an increase in the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. As the enzyme molecules become saturated with substrate, this increase in reaction rate levels off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzyme concentration: Increasing enzyme concentration will speed up the reaction, as long as there is substrate available to bind to. Once all of the substrate is bound, the reaction will no longer speed up, since there will be nothing for additional enzymes to bind to.
