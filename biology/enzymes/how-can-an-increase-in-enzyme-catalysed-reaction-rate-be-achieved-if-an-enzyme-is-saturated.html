<title>How can an increase in enzyme-catalysed reaction rate be achieved if an enzyme is saturated?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Initially, an increase in substrate concentration leads to an increase in the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. As the enzyme molecules become saturated with substrate, this increase in reaction rate levels off. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with an increase in the concentration of an enzyme.As the substrate concentration increases, the enzyme reaction increases until all of the active sites are occupied by the substrate. When all active sites are occupied, the enzyme is saturated. At this saturation point, adding more substrate makes no difference to the reaction rate.Enzyme concentration: Increasing enzyme concentration will speed up the reaction, as long as there is substrate available to bind to. Once all of the substrate is bound, the reaction will no longer speed up, since there will be nothing for additional enzymes to bind to.Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.The catalytic site of the enzyme is empty, waiting for substrate to bind, for much of the time, and the rate at which product can be formed is limited by the concentration of substrate which is available.

<strong> How can an increase in enzyme-catalysed reaction rate be achieved if an enzyme is saturated? 
</strong>
<p>(A) By adding more substrate molecules 
</p>
<p>(B) ** By adding more enzymes 
</p>
<p>(C) By lowering the temperature of the reaction

<p>(D) By changing the pH of the reaction

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Initially, an increase in substrate concentration leads to an increase in the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. As the enzyme molecules become saturated with substrate, this increase in reaction rate levels off. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with an increase in the concentration of an enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As the substrate concentration increases, the enzyme reaction increases until all of the active sites are occupied by the substrate. When all active sites are occupied, the enzyme is saturated. At this saturation point, adding more substrate makes no difference to the reaction rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzyme concentration: Increasing enzyme concentration will speed up the reaction, as long as there is substrate available to bind to. Once all of the substrate is bound, the reaction will no longer speed up, since there will be nothing for additional enzymes to bind to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The catalytic site of the enzyme is empty, waiting for substrate to bind, for much of the time, and the rate at which product can be formed is limited by the concentration of substrate which is available. (B) As the concentration of substrate increases, the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate.
