<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When Harry added an enzyme to a solution with a very acidic pH of 5, she observed that a chemical reaction occurred at a very high rate. Which will she most likely observe if she adds the same enzyme to a solution with a different pH of 12, beyond its optimal pH? He will observe that a chemical reaction did not occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If our substrates and products are equal, we are at equilibrium and adding an enzyme will have no effect on the rate of the reaction. So A is true. Be the reaction is an equilibrium. Like we just said, if the reaction is the equilibrium, adding an enzyme will not have an effect on the reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An enzyme provides an alternate pathway having lower activation energy. The statement (C) is false with respect to an enzyme’s ability to catalyses a reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One enzyme can be used for many different types of chemical reactions. Enzymes are highly specific for the substrate. So they cannot be used for different types of reactions. As lock and key model assumes that a high degree of similarity between the shape of substrate and the geometry of the binding site of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes are only able to function efficiently under a certain range of conditions, and, if conditions slip outside of this range, enzymes may not function at all. One of the factors affecting enzymes is TEMPERATURE. As the temperature rises, substrate molecules begin to move around at an increased rate.
