<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes perform the critical task of lowering a reactionâ€™s activation energy-that is, the amount of energy that must be put in for the reaction to begin. Enzymes work by binding to reactant molecules and holding them in such a way that the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Catalytic Activity of Enzymes First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Catalysts make this process more efficient by lowering the activation energy, which is the energy barrier that must be surmounted for a chemical reaction to occur. As a result, catalysts make it easier for atoms to break and form chemical bonds to produce new combinations and new substances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of extra energy required by a reacting molecule to get converted into product.
