<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein. It speeds up the rate of a specific chemical reaction in the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins that lower the activation energy of chemical reactions. Enzymes that are found in our body made of proteins and are called biological catalysts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzymes in our bodies are catalysts that speed up reactions by helping to lower the activation energy needed to start a reaction. Each enzyme molecule has a special place called the active site where another molecule, called the substrate, fits.
