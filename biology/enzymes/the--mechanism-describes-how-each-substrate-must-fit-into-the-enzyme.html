<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The lock-and-key theory of enzyme action proposes that the enzyme’s active site and the shape of the substrate molecule are complementary to one another. This allows the substrate to fit into the enzyme, like how a key would fit into a lock. If the substrate doesn’t fit, then the enzyme will not act on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A Lock and Key analogy may be used to describe the fundamental action of a single substrate enzyme. In this case, the enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key. Only the correct size key, which is the substrate, enters the keyhole, which is the active site of the lock, which is the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The induced fit model states an substrate binds to an active site and both change shape slightly, creating an ideal fit for catalysis. When an enzyme binds its substrate it forms an enzyme-substrate complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The substrate fits into a part of the enzyme, like a key fits into a lock. Just like a specific key opens a specific lock, each enzyme acts on a specific substrate. The place on the enzyme where the substrate fits-the lock that the key fits into-is called the active site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An enzyme attracts substrates to its active site, catalyzes the chemical reaction by which products are formed, and then allows the products to dissociate (separate from the enzyme surface). The combination formed by an enzyme and its substrates is called the enzyme–substrate complex.
