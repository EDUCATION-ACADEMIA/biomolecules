<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An oxidation–reduction or redox reaction is a reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between chemical species (the atoms, ions, or molecules involved in the reaction).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Oxidation and Reduction. Reduction is a gain of electrons, oxidation is a loss of electrons, and electron transfer reactions are also called redox reactions. Reduction is a gain of electrons. The added electrons “reduce” the oxidation state of the substance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Chemical reactions in which electrons are transferred are called oxidation-reduction, or redox, reactions. Oxidation is the loss of electrons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Reactions involving electron transfers are known as oxidation-reduction reactions (or redox reactions). You may have learned in chemistry that a redox reaction is when one molecule loses electrons and is oxidized, while another molecule gains electrons (the ones lost by the first molecule) and is reduced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Here, the oxidation and reduction process is taking place simultaneously, and electrons transfer is taking place, that’s why this reaction is an example of redox reaction.
