<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer: D-The reactions are too slow to meet the needs of the cell if enzymes are missing. Most commonly, enzymes accelerate biochemical reactions by lowering the amount of activation energy required.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-They speed up biochemical reactions. Under the conditions inside living cells, biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to support life without the help of enzymes. Enzymes increase the rate of biochemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This statement about enzymes is true: Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy. Enzymes are proteins whose three-dimensional form is key to their function. Enzymes do not alter the overall change in free energy for a reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the action of an enzyme? Explanation: Enzymes are biological molecules that help catalyze reactions by lowering the energy of activation and increasing the rate of a reaction.
</p>
