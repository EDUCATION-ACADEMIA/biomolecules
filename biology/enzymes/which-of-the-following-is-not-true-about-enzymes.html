Enzymes are special in that theyre able to catalyze many different reactions without being consumed or used up by the specific reaction.Answer is (1) Enzymes are non-specific for a reaction and substrate.A substrate enters the active site of the enzyme. This forms the enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex. The products then leave the active site of the enzyme.The correct answer: The statement that is false about the enzymes d.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Of the following regarding enzymes, enzymes being consumed by the reaction they catalyze is incorrect. Enzymes are special in that theyâ€™re able to catalyze many different reactions without being consumed or used up by the specific reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer is (1) Enzymes are non-specific for a reaction and substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A substrate enters the active site of the enzyme. This forms the enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex. The products then leave the active site of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The correct answer: The statement that is false about the enzymes d. A specific enzyme can catalyze a variety of chemical reactions.
