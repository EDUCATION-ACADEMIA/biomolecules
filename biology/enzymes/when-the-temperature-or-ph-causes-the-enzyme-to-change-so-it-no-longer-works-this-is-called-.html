<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When exposed to high temperatures and extreme pHs, the protein structure of an enzyme changes, which means the active site also changes shape irreversibly. This is called denaturing and it means that the active site is no longer a complementary shape to the substrate molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When enzymes denature, they are no longer active and cannot function. Extreme temperature and the wrong levels of pH–a measure of a substance’s acidity or alkalinity–can cause enzymes to become denatured.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Changes in pH can cause an enzyme to denature (lose their precise shape) and the substrate won’t fit into the active site. Once an enzyme has denatured, it will not function again. The pH at which enzyme activity is highest is known as the optimum pH. Every enzyme will have its own optimum pH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Denaturation is a change in the 3D structure of the bonds caused by temperature and pH changes above the optimum levels. The enzymes are inactive at a low temperature, and there are small changes in the pH around the optimum value.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As temperature increases, enzyme reactions increase. But if the temperature gets too high, the enzyme stops working.
