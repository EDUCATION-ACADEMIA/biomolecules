<meta name="description" content="An enzyme works optimally at a pH between 2 and 4. Which best explains what will happen to this enzyme at a pH of 12? It will lose its original shape and work on new substrates.Description. Enzyme activity is at its maximum value at the optimum pH. As the pH value is increased above or decreased below the optimum pH the enzyme activity decreases.pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity. Extreme pH values can cause enzymes to denature.Changing the pH will affect the charges on the amino acid molecules. Amino acids that attracted each other may no longer be. Again, the shape of the enzyme, along with its active site, will change. Extremes of pH also denature enzymes.For example, the enzyme pepsin is found in the stomach. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid, which makes the contents of the stomach very acidic. The enzyme pepsin has evolved to work best at a pH of 2, which is the pH of the stomach; the optimal pH for pepsin is 2.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An enzyme works optimally at a pH between 2 and 4. Which best explains what will happen to this enzyme at a pH of 12? It will lose its original shape and work on new substrates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Description. Enzyme activity is at its maximum value at the optimum pH. As the pH value is increased above or decreased below the optimum pH the enzyme activity decreases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity. Extreme pH values can cause enzymes to denature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Changing the pH will affect the charges on the amino acid molecules. Amino acids that attracted each other may no longer be. Again, the shape of the enzyme, along with its active site, will change. Extremes of pH also denature enzymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For example, the enzyme pepsin is found in the stomach. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid, which makes the contents of the stomach very acidic. The enzyme pepsin has evolved to work best at a pH of 2, which is the pH of the stomach; the optimal pH for pepsin is 2.
