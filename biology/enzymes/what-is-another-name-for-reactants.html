<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes have a specific location where reactants are brought together to react. These reactants are called substrates and the specific binding location is called the active site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Substrates in Other Sciences The term substrate is sometimes used interchangeably with the term reactant, which refers to the molecule consumed in a chemical reaction. Substrate in biology: The substrate is the surface on which an organism grows or is attached in biology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is another word for the substrate? Substratum or underlayer is used as the synonym for “substrate”. Substrate (biology definition): (1) In ecology, it is the earthy material where an organism lives or the surface or medium where an organism grows or is attached.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Substrates are the substances on which enzymes act. Enzymes are named by adding the suffix-ase to the name of the substrate that they modify (i.e., urease and tyrosinase), or the type of reaction they catalyze (dehydrogenase, decarboxylase). Some have arbitrary names (pepsin and trypsin).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In chemistry, a substrate is typically the chemical species being observed in a chemical reaction, which reacts with a reagent to generate a product. It can also refer to a surface on which other chemical reactions are performed, or play a supporting role in a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.
