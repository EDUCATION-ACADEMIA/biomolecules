<title>When energy is stored as sugar it is a ..... reaction
</title>
<meta name="description" content="An example of an exothermic reaction is cellular respiration. High-energy glucose releases energy as its broken down. And that energy is used to generate ATP molecules. Since we know that photosynthesis absorbs light energy and stores it in its product glucose, we know that its an endothermic chemical reaction.Therefore, the dissolution of sugar in water is endothermic. Since sugar is absorbing heat from the water, it means to get dissolved effectively it will be needing much heat, hence, the provided or supplied water should be hot to provide enough energy to the sugar molecules to get dissolved.Energy released or stored in a reaction will often be expressed written as ΔH, or a change in enthalpy. A positive ΔH means that energy is stored and the reaction is endothermic. A negative ΔH means that energy is released and the reaction is exothermic.Answer – endothermic as heat (energy) is absorbed by the sugar to change phases.decomposition reaction.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An example of an exothermic reaction is cellular respiration. High-energy glucose releases energy as it’s broken down. And that energy is used to generate ATP molecules. Since we know that photosynthesis absorbs light energy and stores it in its product glucose, we know that it’s an endothermic chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Therefore, the dissolution of sugar in water is endothermic. Since sugar is absorbing heat from the water, it means to get dissolved effectively it will be needing much heat, hence, the provided or supplied water should be hot to provide enough energy to the sugar molecules to get dissolved.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Energy released or stored in a reaction will often be expressed written as H, or a change in enthalpy. A positive H means that energy is stored and the reaction is endothermic. A negative H means that energy is released and the reaction is exothermic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer – endothermic as heat (energy) is absorbed by the sugar to change phases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-decomposition reaction. Since the energy term is a product, this is an EXOthermic reaction.
