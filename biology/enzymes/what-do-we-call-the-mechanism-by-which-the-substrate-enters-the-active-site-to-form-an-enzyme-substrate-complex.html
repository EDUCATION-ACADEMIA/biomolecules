<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This adjustment of the enzyme to snugly fit the substrate is called induced fit. Illustration of the induced fit model of enzyme catalysis. As a substrate binds to the active site, the active site changes shape a little, grasping the substrate more tightly and preparing to catalyze the reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An enzyme attracts substrates to its active site, catalyzes the chemical reaction by which products are formed, and then allows the products to dissociate (separate from the enzyme surface). The combination formed by an enzyme and its substrates is called the enzyme–substrate complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The induced fit model states an substrate binds to an active site and both change shape slightly, creating an ideal fit for catalysis. When an enzyme binds its substrate it forms an enzyme-substrate complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A Lock and Key analogy may be used to describe the fundamental action of a single substrate enzyme. In this case, the enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key. Only the correct size key, which is the substrate, enters the keyhole, which is the active site of the lock, which is the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Lock-and-key model is a model for enzyme-substrate interaction suggesting that the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another. Enzymes are highly specific. They must bind to a specific substrate before they can catalyze a chemical reaction.
