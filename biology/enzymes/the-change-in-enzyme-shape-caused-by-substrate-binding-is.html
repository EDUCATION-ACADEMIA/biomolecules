<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Instead, an enzyme changes shape slightly when it binds its substrate, resulting in an even tighter fit. This adjustment of the enzyme to snugly fit the substrate is called induced fit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The induced-fit model states a substrate binds to an active site and both change shape slightly, creating an ideal fit for catalysis. Enzymes promote chemical reactions by bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation, thus creating an ideal chemical environment for the reaction to occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Induced fit indicates a continuous change in the conformation and shape of an enzyme in response to substrate binding. This makes the enzyme catalytic which results in the lowering of the activation energy barrier causing an increase in the overall rate of the reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the induced fit model, both the substrate and the active site of the enzyme change in conformation until the substrate is completely bound to the enzyme, at which point the final shape and charge is determined. This activates the enzyme into performing its catalytic function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The substrate binds to the enzyme undergoing a conformational change, breaking it down into products. The enzymes change their shape which is known as induced fit. Enzymes can reverse back to their original shape once the reaction is carried out.
