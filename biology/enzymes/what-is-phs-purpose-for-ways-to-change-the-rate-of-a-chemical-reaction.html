<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-pH: Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing the pH outside of this range will slow enzyme activity. Extreme pH values can cause enzymes to denature. Enzyme concentration: Increasing enzyme concentration will speed up the reaction, as long as there is substrate available to bind to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Effect of pH on Enzymes The rate of enzymatic reaction depends on pH of the medium. Each enzyme has an optimum pH, where the rate of enzymatic reaction is maximum. At higher or lower pH, the rate of an enzymatic reaction decreases. For most enzymes, the optimum pH lies in the range from pH 5 to pH 9.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Effect of pH on reaction rate. The structure of the enzyme has a great influence on the activity of the enzyme. In other words, changes in the structure of the enzyme affect the rate of chemical reactions. When the pH value of the reaction medium changes, the shape and structure of the enzyme will change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The optimal pH for enzymes is 7 because that is neutral pH and the natural pH of most living things. At pH 7 there is an equal balance of acid and base and this pH is considered neutral.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Changing the pH will affect the charges on the amino acid molecules. Amino acids that attracted each other may no longer be. Again, the shape of the enzyme, along with its active site, will change. Extremes of pH also denature enzymes.
