<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A substrate enters the active site of the enzyme. This forms the enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex. The products then leave the active site of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are reusable. Once an enzyme binds to a substrate and catalyzes the reaction, the enzyme is released, unchanged, and can be used for another reaction. This means that for each reaction, there does not need to be a 1:1 ratio between enzyme and substrate molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes let chemical reactions in the body happen millions of times faster than without the enzyme. Because enzymes are not part of the product, they can be reused again and again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzyme-Substrate (ES) complexes are formed during enzyme catalysed chemical reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An enzyme attracts substrates to its active site, catalyzes the chemical reaction by which products are formed, and then allows the products to dissociate (separate from the enzyme surface). The combination formed by an enzyme and its substrates is called the enzyme–substrate complex.
