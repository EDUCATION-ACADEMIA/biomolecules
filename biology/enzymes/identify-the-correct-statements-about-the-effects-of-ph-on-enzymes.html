<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer: The optimum pH for an enzyme is d) Where it works best. Optimum pH for an enzyme is the specific pH at which the enzyme can work the best.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzyme activity is at its maximum value at the optimum pH. As the pH value is increased above or decreased below the optimum pH the enzyme activity decreases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Effect of pH on Enzymes The rate of enzymatic reaction depends on pH of the medium. Each enzyme has an optimum pH, where the rate of enzymatic reaction is maximum. At higher or lower pH, the rate of an enzymatic reaction decreases. For most enzymes, the optimum pH lies in the range from pH 5 to pH 9.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Although some enzymes exhibit activity in a broad range of pH [1–3], many show maximal activity at a narrow pH range [4–6], referred to as the pH optimum.
