<title>The enzymes become denatured if the temperature is ..... compared to its optimum temperature.
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Additional Information:-The optimum temp of enzymes is 20-35°C. They become inactivated at very low temperature and denatured (destroyed) at very high temp i.e. greater than 45°C.Optimum temperature is the temperature at which enzyme activity is maximum. In humans, this temperature is 37.5oC that is same as the normal body temperature. A rise in temperature above 40oC results in denaturation of the proteins of enzyme.Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.High heat destroys enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.As shown in the example graph, treating the enzyme to temperatures above 40°C causes a marked decrease in the reaction rate. Since the reaction occurred at room temperature, we know that the enzyme begins to denature at temperatures greater than 40°C.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Additional Information:-The optimum temp of enzymes is 20-35°C. They become inactivated at very low temperature and denatured (destroyed) at very high temp i.e. greater than 45°C.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Optimum temperature is the temperature at which enzyme activity is maximum. In humans, this temperature is 37.5oC that is same as the normal body temperature. A rise in temperature above 40oC results in denaturation of the proteins of enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-High heat destroys enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As shown in the example graph, treating the enzyme to temperatures above 40°C causes a marked decrease in the reaction rate. Since the reaction occurred at room temperature, we know that the enzyme begins to denature at temperatures greater than 40°C.
