<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A catalyst is a substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate without getting consumed in the process. Catalysts typically speed up a reaction by reducing the activation energy or changing the reaction mechanism. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction-without being a reactant-is called a catalyst. The catalysts for biochemical reactions that happen in living organisms are called enzymes. Enzymes are usually proteins, though some ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules act as enzymes too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Catalysts make this process more efficient by lowering the activation energy, which is the energy barrier that must be surmounted for a chemical reaction to occur. As a result, catalysts make it easier for atoms to break and form chemical bonds to produce new combinations and new substances.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes are proteins that lower the activation energy of chemical reactions. Enzymes that are found in our body made of proteins and are called biological catalysts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-By altering the reactionâ€™s transition state, a catalyst lowers the activation energy. After that, the reaction follows a different mechanism than the uncatalyzed reaction.
