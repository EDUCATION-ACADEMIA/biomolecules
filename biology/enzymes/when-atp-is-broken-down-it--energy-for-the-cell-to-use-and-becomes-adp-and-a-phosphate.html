<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If a cell needs to spend energy to accomplish a task, the ATP molecule splits off one of its three phosphates, becoming ADP (Adenosine di-phosphate) + phosphate. The energy holding that phosphate molecule is now released and available to do work for the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-ATP breakdown into ADP and Pi is called hydrolysis because it consumes a water molecule (hydro-, meaning “water”, and lysis, meaning “separation”). Figure: Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP): ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. It has an adenosine backbone with three phosphate groups attached.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The hydrolysis of 1M of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, releases −7.3 kcal/mol of energy. The energy released in the living cell is almost double the value in standard conditions, it is equal to −14 kcal/mol.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-ATP to ADP – Energy Release When the bond connecting the phosphate is broken, energy is released.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP + Pi is used to perform cellular work. Cells use ATP to perform work by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. ATP donates its phosphate group to another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation.
