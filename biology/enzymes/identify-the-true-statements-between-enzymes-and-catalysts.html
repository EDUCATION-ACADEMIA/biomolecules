<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes catalyze the reaction by lowering the activation energy which is required to initiate the reaction. Through this mechanism, the reaction can be catalyzed at a fast rate. Hence, it is the correct option.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Difference between enzyme and catalyst Enzymes are proteins that increase rate of chemical reactions converting substrate into product. Catalysts are substances that increase or decrease the rate of a chemical reaction but remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein. It speeds up the rate of a specific chemical reaction in the cell. The enzyme is not destroyed during the reaction and is used over and over.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes (and other catalysts) act by reducing the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reaction. The increased rate is the same in both the forward and reverse directions, since both must pass through the same transition state.
