<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Reversible reaction is one in which system can be brought back to its initial state without leaving any effect on surrounding. Thus, reactions in which products can be converted to reactant is called Reversible reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The chemical reaction in which the products formed react together to form the original reactants is known as reversible reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Reversible reactions can go in both the forward and backward directions. In a reversible reaction, reactants turn into products, but products also turn back into reactants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions. The reactants can change to the products, and the products can also change back to the reactants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Reversible reaction reaches equilibrium. Reversible reaction fastens forward reaction.
