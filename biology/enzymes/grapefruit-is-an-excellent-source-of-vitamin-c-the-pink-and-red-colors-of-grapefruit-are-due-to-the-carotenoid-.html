<meta name="description" content="Two carotene pigments produce the grapefruit colors: beta-carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A, is responsible for the pink hues, and lycopene, a different pigment, causes the darker red hues. Lighter colored grapefruits have less pigment, while pink and red-colored grapefruits have more pigment.The colour of pink and red grapefruits is caused by the compound lycopene. This is a compound composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The compound absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, causing it to appear red. Lycopene is also the compound responsible for the colouration of tomatoes.Grapefruits, like oranges and other citrus fruits, are high in vitamin C. In fact, one whole, medium grapefruit provides you with 100% of your daily requirement for vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that is great for your immune system and can help you fight off viruses and bacteria that can cause disease.Like many citrus fruits, grapefruit is loaded with vitamin C, a nutrient shown to help boost your bodys immune system. Grapefruit is also loaded with Vitamin A, another vitamin that has been proven to help immune function. This powerful combination could help keep the amount of time you spend sick to a minimum.In this study, the obtained results revealed that the wasted parts, particularly the peels of lemon, orange, and grapefruit, contain appreciable amounts of phenolic compound and vitamin C as well as high antioxidant activity rate.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Two carotene pigments produce the grapefruit colors: beta-carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A, is responsible for the pink hues, and lycopene, a different pigment, causes the darker red hues. Lighter colored grapefruits have less pigment, while pink and red-colored grapefruits have more pigment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The colour of pink and red grapefruits is caused by the compound lycopene. This is a compound composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The compound absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, causing it to appear red. Lycopene is also the compound responsible for the colouration of tomatoes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Grapefruits, like oranges and other citrus fruits, are high in vitamin C. In fact, one whole, medium grapefruit provides you with 100% of your daily requirement for vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that is great for your immune system and can help you fight off viruses and bacteria that can cause disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Like many citrus fruits, grapefruit is loaded with vitamin C, a nutrient shown to help boost your bodyâ€™s immune system. Grapefruit is also loaded with Vitamin A, another vitamin that has been proven to help immune function. This powerful combination could help keep the amount of time you spend sick to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In this study, the obtained results revealed that the wasted parts, particularly the peels of lemon, orange, and grapefruit, contain appreciable amounts of phenolic compound and vitamin C as well as high antioxidant activity rate.
