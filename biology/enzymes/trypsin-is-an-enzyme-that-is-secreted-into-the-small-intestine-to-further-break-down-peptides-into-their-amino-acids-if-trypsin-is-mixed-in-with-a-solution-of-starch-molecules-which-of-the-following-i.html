<strong> Trypsin is an enzyme that is secreted into the small intestine to further break down peptides into their amino acids. If trypsin is mixed in with a solution of starch molecules, which of the following is most likely to happen? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Trypsin will break down the starch if the pH is within the optimum range. 
</p>
<p>(B) Trypsin will break down the starch if the temperature is within the optimum range. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Trypsin will not break down the starch because enzymes are substrate specific. 
</p>
<p>(D) Trypsin will not breakdown the starch if the solution is not in the small intestine.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Trypsin is an enzyme that helps us digest protein. In the small intestine, trypsin breaks down proteins, continuing the process of digestion that began in the stomach. It may also be referred to as a proteolytic enzyme, or proteinase. Trypsin is produced by the pancreas in an inactive form called trypsinogen.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Trypsin elastase, carboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme. Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those that break down peptides).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Erepsin is an enzyme which is used to convert the peptides into amino acids. It is a protein fraction found in the intestinal juices. It is produced and secreted by the intestinal glands in the ileum and the pancreas.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond between the carboxyl group of arginine or the carboxyl group of lysine and the amino group of the adjacent amino acid.
