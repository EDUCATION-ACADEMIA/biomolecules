<title>What happens to the reaction rate if an enzyme is denatured or nonfunctional?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Above a certain temperature, activity begins to decline because the enzyme begins to denature. The rate of chemical reactions therefore increases with temperature but then decreases as enzymes denature.If enzymes are denatured, they lose the shape of their active sites which means they cannot bind to their substrate, decreasing the rate of reaction.Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working.This means that as the enzyme concentration decreases, the reaction rate will decrease. In most biological environments, the concentration of the enzyme is lower than the concentration of the substrate. The relationship between enzyme concentration and enzyme activity is directly proportional.Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Protein folding is key to whether a globular protein or a membrane protein can do its job correctly.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Above a certain temperature, activity begins to decline because the enzyme begins to denature. The rate of chemical reactions therefore increases with temperature but then decreases as enzymes denature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If enzymes are denatured, they lose the shape of their active sites which means they cannot bind to their substrate, decreasing the rate of reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This means that as the enzyme concentration decreases, the reaction rate will decrease. In most biological environments, the concentration of the enzyme is lower than the concentration of the substrate. The relationship between enzyme concentration and enzyme activity is directly proportional.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Protein folding is key to whether a globular protein or a membrane protein can do its job correctly.
