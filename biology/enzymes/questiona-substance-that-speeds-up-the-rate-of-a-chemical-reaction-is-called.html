<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction, or lowers the temperature or pressure needed to start one, without itself being consumed during the reaction. Catalysis is the process of adding a catalyst to facilitate a reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In general, catalytic action is a chemical reaction between the catalyst and a reactant, forming chemical intermediates that are able to react more readily with each other or with another reactant, to form the desired end product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The rate of a reaction can be increased by adding a suitable catalyst. A catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a chemical reaction but it is not used up (remains chemically unchanged at the end). It provides an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction. A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative pathway or mechanism for the reaction to follow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Catalysts are generally foreign substances but sometimes one of the product formed may act as a catalyst and such a catalyst is called “auto catalyst” and the phenomenon is called auto catalysis.
