<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The substance(s) to the left of the arrow in a chemical equation are called reactants. A reactant is a substance that is present at the start of a chemical reaction. The substance(s) to the right of the arrow are called products. A product is a substance that is present at the end of a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The reactants are listed on the left side of the equation, while the products are listed on the right. The direction of the reaction is shown by an arrow pointing from the reactants to the products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Products: Products are the chemical substances formed by a chemical reaction. They are found on the right-hand side of a chemical equation. Yield: A chemical equation doesn’t use an equal sign. It uses a right-pointing arrow that means “yield.” The reactants yield products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations. Chemical equations have reactants on the left, an arrow that is read as “yields", and the products on the right.
