<title>You do an experiment to test for catalase using the potato strip and hydrogen peroxide. You noticed that if you repeat the experiment again with the same potato, bubbles can be seen again! Why?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Catalase breaks down two hydrogen peroxide molecules into one molecule of oxygen [9] and two molecules of water in a two-step reaction [10].Answer and Explanation: A potato contains a enzyme called catalase. Catalase speeds up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 H 2 O 2 ) into water and oxygen (which forms the bubbles) as the reaction happens very slowly at room temperature.Catalase, an enzyme found inside a potato, breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. The advantage of this reaction is that you can see the oxygen gas bubbling out as it is formed so you can tell how fast the reaction is happening.The frozen potato should have produced fewer bubbles than the room temperature sample because the cold temperature slowed the catalase enzymes ability to decompose the hydrogen peroxide. The room temperature potato produced the most bubbles because catalase works best at a room temperature.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Catalase breaks down two hydrogen peroxide molecules into one molecule of oxygen [9] and two molecules of water in a two-step reaction [10].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: A potato contains a enzyme called catalase. Catalase speeds up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 H 2 O 2 ) into water and oxygen (which forms the bubbles) as the reaction happens very slowly at room temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Catalase, an enzyme found inside a potato, breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. The advantage of this reaction is that you can see the oxygen gas bubbling out as it is formed so you can tell how fast the reaction is happening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The frozen potato should have produced fewer bubbles than the room temperature sample because the cold temperature slowed the catalase enzymeâ€™s ability to decompose the hydrogen peroxide. The room temperature potato produced the most bubbles because catalase works best at a room temperature.
