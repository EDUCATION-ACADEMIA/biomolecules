<title>Why does enzyme activity decrease when it is in solution that has either a too high or too low pH?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The change of pH will lead to the ionization of amino acids atoms and molecules, change the shape and structure of proteins, thus damaging the function of proteins. Enzymes are also proteins, which are also affected by changes in pH.Acidic solutions have more hydrogen ions which means more positive charges. These positive charges affect the charges of the amino acids inside the protein which render the enzyme more or less active depending on the optimal pH of the enzyme.An optimum activity is reached at the enzymes optimum pH, pH 8 in this example. A continued increase in pH results in a sharp decrease in activity as the enzymes active site changes shape. It is now denatured.Extremely high or low pH values generally result in complete loss of activity for most enzymes. pH is also a factor in the stability of enzymes. As with activity, for each enzyme there is also a region of pH optimal stability.">

<strong> Why does enzyme activity decrease when it is in solution that has either a too high or too low pH? 
</strong>
<p>(A) All enzymes only work in neutral solutions 
</p>
<p>(B) Enzyme activity remains unchanged in different pH’s 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The shape of the active site changes 
</p>
<p>(D) The shape of the substrate changes

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The change of pH will lead to the ionization of amino acids atoms and molecules, change the shape and structure of proteins, thus damaging the function of proteins. Enzymes are also proteins, which are also affected by changes in pH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Acidic solutions have more hydrogen ions which means more positive charges. These positive charges affect the charges of the amino acids inside the protein which render the enzyme more or less active depending on the optimal pH of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An optimum activity is reached at the enzyme’s optimum pH, pH 8 in this example. A continued increase in pH results in a sharp decrease in activity as the enzyme’s active site changes shape. It is now denatured.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Extremely high or low pH values generally result in complete loss of activity for most enzymes. pH is also a factor in the stability of enzymes. As with activity, for each enzyme there is also a region of pH optimal stability.
