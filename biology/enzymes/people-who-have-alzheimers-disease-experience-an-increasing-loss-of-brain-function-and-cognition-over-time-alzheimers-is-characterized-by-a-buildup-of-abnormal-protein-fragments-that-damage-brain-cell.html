<title>People who have Alzheimers disease experience an increasing loss of brain function and cognition over time. Alzheimers is characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein fragments that damage brain cells. Recently scientists have discovered an enzyme, BACE2, that decreases these abnormal protein fragments in the brain of a person with Alzheimers disease. Which statement explains how BACE2 most likely works?

<strong> People who have Alzheimer’s disease experience an increasing loss of brain function and cognition over time. Alzheimer’s is characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein fragments that damage brain cells. Recently scientists have discovered an enzyme, BACE2, that decreases these abnormal protein fragments in the brain of a person with Alzheimer’s disease. Which statement explains how BACE2 most likely works? 
</strong>
<p>(A) BACE2 breaks down into smaller pieces that react with the abnormal protein fragments, forming more complex molecules. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** BACE2 speeds up the reaction that breaks down the abnormal protein fragments. 
</p>
<p>(C) BACE2 molecules link several abnormal protein fragments together, forming a complete protein. 
</p>
<p>(D) BACE2 is a reactant that combines with the abnormal protein fragments.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In Alzheimer’s disease, as neurons are injured and die throughout the brain, connections between networks of neurons may break down, and many brain regions begin to shrink. By the final stages of Alzheimer’s, this process-called brain atrophy-is widespread, causing significant loss of brain volume.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disease. It is characterized by changes in the brain-including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles-that result in loss of neurons and their connections.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Alzheimer’s disease is thought to be caused by the abnormal build-up of proteins in and around brain cells. One of the proteins involved is called amyloid, deposits of which form plaques around brain cells. The other protein is called tau, deposits of which form tangles within brain cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The protein encoded by FAM222A is predominantly expressed in the CNS and is increased in brains of patients with AD and in an AD mouse model. It accumulates within amyloid deposits, physically interacts with amyloid- (A) via its N-terminal A binding domain, and facilitates A aggregation.
