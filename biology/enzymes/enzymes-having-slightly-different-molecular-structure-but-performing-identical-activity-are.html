<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Enzymes which have minor differences in their molecular structure but perform identical catalytic activity are called isoenzymes or isozymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Isoenzymes (also called isozymes) are alternative forms of the same enzyme activity that exist in different proportions in different tissues. Isoenzymes differ in amino acid composition and sequence and multimeric quaternary structure; mostly, but not always, they have similar (conserved) structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A ligand-bound enzyme structure is crucial for rational design of an enzyme with improved substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Definition of Isozymes or Isoenzymes. The 1964 Committee recommended (1) that “multiple enzyme forms” in a single species should be known as isoenzymes (or isozymes). It is known that enzymes catalyzing essentially the same reaction may differ in various ways, as shown in Table 1.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In biochemistry, isozymes (also known as isoenzymes or more generally as multiple forms of enzymes) are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same chemical reaction. Isozymes usually have different kinetic parameters (e.g. different KM values), or are regulated differently.
