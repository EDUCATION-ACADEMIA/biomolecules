<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Specificity is a property of the enzyme and describes how restrictive the enzyme is in its choice of substrate; a completely specific enzyme would have only one substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Since the substrate must fit into the active site of the enzyme before catalysis can occur, only properly designed molecules can serve as substrates for a specific enzyme; in many cases, an enzyme will react with only one naturally occurring molecule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes only work with specific substrates because each substrate has a unique 3 dimensional shape. For enzymes to catalyze a reaction they need to bind the substrate and then they need to interact with the substrate in the active site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes are highly specific in action. Almost every biochemical reaction is controlled by its own specific enzymes. Thus, the enzyme urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea. No other enzyme catalyzes this reaction.

</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
