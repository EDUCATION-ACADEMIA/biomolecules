<title>Most chemical reactions in the body rely on enzymes. Why are enzymes are necessary for many cellular reactions?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Enzymes in our bodies are catalysts that speed up reactions by helping to lower the activation energy needed to start a reaction.First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.Answer and Explanation: The human body needs many different enzymes because of all of its complex metabolic activities and processes. The enzymes act as catalysts to the various metabolic chemical reactions that take place, and once the enzyme is used to catalyze a reaction, its gone, so it needs to be replaced.They act as catalysts, which means that they make biochemical reactions happen faster than they would otherwise. Without enzymes, those reactions simply would not occur or would run too slowly to sustain life. For example, without enzymes, digestion would be impossible.">

<strong> Most chemical reactions in the body rely on enzymes. Why are enzymes are necessary for many cellular reactions? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The reactions are too slow to meet the needs of the cell if enzymes are missing 
</p>
<p>(B) The reactions take up too much space in the cell if enzymes are missing 
</p>
<p>(C) Enzymes change reactants from solid to liquid during the reactions. 
</p>
<p>(D) Enzymes supply the oxygen necessary for the reactions.
