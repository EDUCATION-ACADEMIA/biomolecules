<strong> Enzymes are “Sensitive” which best describes this? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** function best under certain environmental conditions 
</p>
<p>(B) speeds up only one type of reaction. (Like a lock and key!!!) Example:Amylase-only breaks down starches. 
</p>
<p>(C) can catalyze the same reaction over and over again. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-pH: Enzymes are sensitive to acidity and alkalinity. They don’t work properly if an environment is too acidic or basic. For example, an enzyme in the stomach called pepsin breaks down proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzyme activity can be affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, pH, and concentration. Enzymes work best within specific temperature and pH ranges, and sub-optimal conditions can cause an enzyme to lose its ability to bind to a substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-temperature, pH, and salt. Enzyme activity is influenced by several environmental factors such as temperature, salt, pH, and substrate concentration. Low or high values of these factors will cause alteration in a structure that will further disrupt its functioning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes work best when there is a high enough substrate concentration for the reaction they catalyse. If too little substrate is available the rate of the reaction is slowed and cannot increase any further. Sometimes, if there is too much product accumulating, the reaction can also be slowed down.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Explanation: The temperature and pH of the environment, as well as the concentration of the substrate and enzyme, all affect the rate at which an enzyme catalyzes a reaction. As a result, enzymes have optimal conditions in which they can work at peak efficiency.
