<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Induced-fit model stated that when the substrate comes in contact with the active site, the active site modulates according to the shape of the substrate to form an enzyme-substrate complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In allosteric control. …the basis of the so-called induced-fit theory, which states that the binding of a substrate or some other molecule to an enzyme causes a change in the shape of the enzyme so as to enhance or inhibit its activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Induced fit Instead, an enzyme changes shape slightly when it binds its substrate, resulting in an even tighter fit. This adjustment of the enzyme to snugly fit the substrate is called induced fit. Illustration of the induced fit model of enzyme catalysis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The induced-fit model states a substrate binds to an active site and both change shape slightly, creating an ideal fit for catalysis. Enzymes promote chemical reactions by bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation, thus creating an ideal chemical environment for the reaction to occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Induced fit indicates a continuous change in the conformation and shape of an enzyme in response to substrate binding. This makes the enzyme catalytic which results in the lowering of the activation energy barrier causing an increase in the overall rate of the reaction.
