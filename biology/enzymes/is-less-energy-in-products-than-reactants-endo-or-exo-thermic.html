<title>is less energy in products than reactants endo or exo thermic

<meta name="description" content="In case of an exothermic reaction, reactants are at lower energy than products.Answer and Explanation: In the potential energy diagram, if the products have less energy than the reactants, then there is a release of energy. This kind of reaction is classified as exothermic and accompanied by negative enthalpy change.In an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed during the reaction, and the products thus have a larger quantity of energy than the reactants. This means that the products are less stable than the reactants.Because energy is a product, energy is given off by the reaction. Therefore, this reaction is exothermic. Because energy is a reactant, energy is absorbed by the reaction.In an exothermic reaction, the bonds in the product have higher bond energy (stronger bonds) than the reactants. In other words, the energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants, hence is energetically downhill, shown in Figure 7.5.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In case of an exothermic reaction, reactants are at lower energy than products.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: In the potential energy diagram, if the products have less energy than the reactants, then there is a release of energy. This kind of reaction is classified as exothermic and accompanied by negative enthalpy change.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed during the reaction, and the products thus have a larger quantity of energy than the reactants. This means that the products are less stable than the reactants.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Because energy is a product, energy is given off by the reaction. Therefore, this reaction is exothermic. Because energy is a reactant, energy is absorbed by the reaction.
