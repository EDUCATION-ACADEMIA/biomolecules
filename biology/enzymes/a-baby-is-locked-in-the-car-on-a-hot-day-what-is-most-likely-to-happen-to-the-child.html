<meta name="description" content="A baby is locked in the car on a hot day. What is most likely to happen to the child? The childs enzymes will denature causing chemical reactions to slow down in the body, which will lead to death.Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.As the temperature increases so does the rate of enzyme activity. An optimum activity is reached at the enzymes optimum temperature. A continued increase in temperature results in a sharp decrease in activity as the enzymes active site changes shape.Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working.Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.">

<strong> A baby is locked in the car on a hot day. What is most likely to happen to the child? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The child’s body will adjust and cause it to maintain homeostasis 
</p>
<p>(B) The child’s enzymes will denature causing chemical reactions to speed up in the body, which will lead to death. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The child’s enzymes will denature causing chemical reactions to slow down in the body, which will lead to death. 
</p>
<p>(D) The activation energy for chemical reactions will remain unchanged and therefore the child will live.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A baby is locked in the car on a hot day. What is most likely to happen to the child? The child’s enzymes will denature causing chemical reactions to slow down in the body, which will lead to death.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As the temperature increases so does the rate of enzyme activity. An optimum activity is reached at the enzyme’s optimum temperature. A continued increase in temperature results in a sharp decrease in activity as the enzyme’s active site changes shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Temperature: Raising temperature generally speeds up a reaction, and lowering temperature slows down a reaction. However, extreme high temperatures can cause an enzyme to lose its shape (denature) and stop working.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.
