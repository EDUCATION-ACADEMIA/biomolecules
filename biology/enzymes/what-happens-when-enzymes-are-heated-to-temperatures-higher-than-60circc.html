<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Further increasing the temperature, the enzyme activity slows down and ultimately stops because at high temperatures, the enzyme gets denatured. Enzymes are proteins. At very high temperature, the bonds between amino acids gets broken. This leads to change in the shape of the enzyme.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Because enzymes are proteins, they are denatured by heat. Therefore, at higher temperatures (over about 55°C in the graph below) there is a rapid loss of activity as the protein suffers irreversible denaturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Enzymes are protein molecules that get denatured at high temperatures. High heat breaks hydrogen and ionic bonds leading to disruption in enzyme shape. The enzyme loses its activity and can no longer bind to the substrate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Higher temperatures disrupt the shape of the active site, which will reduce its activity, or prevent it from working. The enzyme will have been denatured . Enzymes therefore work best at a particular temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As we can see in the enzyme activity plot, 60 degrees C is well above the optimal range for the human enzyme. At temperatures that are too high, enzymes become denatured, losing their three-dimensional structure or tertiary structure.
