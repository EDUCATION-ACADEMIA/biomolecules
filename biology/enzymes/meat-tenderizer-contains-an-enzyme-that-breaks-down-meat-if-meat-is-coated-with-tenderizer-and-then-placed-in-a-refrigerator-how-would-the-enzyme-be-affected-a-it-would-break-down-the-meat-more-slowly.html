<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The enzymes will not increase the rate of reactions as much as they would at 70 °C . 62 . Many of the proteins in the human body are enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-3. Meat tenderizer contains an enzyme that interacts with meat. If meat is coated with tenderizer and then placed in a refrigerator for a short time, how would the enzyme be affected? (1) It would be broken down.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Papain breaks down the protein sheath around meat fibers and make the meat easier to chew. Commercial meat tenderizers such as Adolph=s, contains papain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Proteins contain lots of amino acids linked together in chains to make large molecules. Meat tenderisers act by breaking apart the amino acids. Marinades designed to tenderise meat usually contain acids or enzymes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Denaturation of a protein or an enzyme involves the disruption of its secondary and tertiary structure (which was previously stabilized by different types of bonds). Once an enzyme is denatured, it is no longer functional as its active site is disrupted.
