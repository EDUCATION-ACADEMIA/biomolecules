<title>After the enzyme and substrate bind together and perform the reaction, what does the substrate become?

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A substrate enters the active site of the enzyme. This forms the enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction then occurs, converting the substrate into products and forming an enzyme products complex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that confirms an more productive binding arrangement between the enzyme and the transition state of the substrate. This energetically favorable binding maximizes the enzyme’s ability to catalyze its reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The substrate goes through a chemical reaction and changes into a new molecule called the product-sort of like when a key goes into a lock and the lock opens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The bound substrate is converted to product by catalytic groups in the active site, forming the enzyme-product complex (EP). The bound products are released, returning the enzyme to its unbound form, ready to catalyze another round of converting substrate to product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The substrate bound to the enzyme undergoes a conformational change, acquiring a tense state, from which it easily passes to form the product(s). This state of tension, or intermediary transition, of the substrate is the mechanism by which the enzyme reduces the activation energy required to catalyze the reaction.
