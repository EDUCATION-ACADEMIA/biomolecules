<title>When energy is released as ATP when sugar is broken down, therefore is it a ..... reaction
</title>
<meta name="description" content="In this reaction energy is released, it is also an exothermic reaction. Glucose oxidizes and releases energy in the human body. Thus, this reaction is reacted with oxygen called oxidation reaction. So, the process of respiration is an oxidation reaction which is exothermic.During various cellular activities, the energy released by the breakdown of ATP is used to drive endothermic reactions in the cell.The energy from catabolism must be conserved or transformed into chemical storage. The major chemical storage is in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the link between exothermic reactions and endothermic reactions.When one phosphate group is removed by breaking a phosphoanhydride bond in a process called hydrolysis, energy is released, and ATP is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).The most important process in stage 2 of the breakdown of food molecules is the degradation of glucose in the sequence of reactions known as glycolysis-from the Greek glukus, sweet, and lusis, rupture. Glycolysis produces ATP without the involvement of molecular oxygen (O2 gas).">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In this reaction energy is released, it is also an exothermic reaction. Glucose oxidizes and releases energy in the human body. Thus, this reaction is reacted with oxygen called oxidation reaction. So, the process of respiration is an oxidation reaction which is exothermic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During various cellular activities, the energy released by the breakdown of ATP is used to drive endothermic reactions in the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The energy from catabolism must be conserved or transformed into chemical storage. The major chemical storage is in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the link between exothermic reactions and endothermic reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When one phosphate group is removed by breaking a phosphoanhydride bond in a process called hydrolysis, energy is released, and ATP is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
</p>

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The most important process in stage 2 of the breakdown of food molecules is the degradation of glucose in the sequence of reactions known as glycolysis-from the Greek glukus, “sweet, ” and lusis, “rupture.” Glycolysis produces ATP without the involvement of molecular oxygen (O2 gas).
