<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The aldehyde can be oxidized via a redox reaction in which another compound is reduced. Thus, aldoses are reducing sugars. Sugars with ketone groups in their open chain form are capable of isomerizing via a series of tautomeric shifts to produce an aldehyde group in solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The physiologically important sugar acids are aldonic and uronic acids. An aldonic acid is obtained when the aldehyde group in an aldo sugar is oxidized; thus, oxidation of D-glucose at C1 yields D-gluconic acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sugars that contain aldehyde groups that are oxidised to carboxylic acids are classified as reducing sugars. Common test reagents are : Benedicts reagent (CuSO4 / citrate)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The aldehyde functional group of aldoses can be oxidized to carboxyl groups under the action of mild oxidants, forming aldonic acids. The aldonic acid formed by the oxidation of carbon 1 in glucose is designated gluconic acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The primary fermentable sugars found in grapes are glucose and fructose. These two simple sugars are also known as reducing sugars because they contain functional groups capable of being oxidized under certain conditions.
