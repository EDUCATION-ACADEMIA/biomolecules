<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Polysaccharides. A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly-= “many”).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Disaccharides. Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide units linked together by a glycosidic bond. The most common glycosidic bonds connecting monosaccharide units are O-glycosidic bonds in which the oxygen from a hydroxyl group becomes linked to the carbonyl carbon.
