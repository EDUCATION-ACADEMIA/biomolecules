<title>What are the disaccharides?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharide units, linked by glycosidic bonds in the α or β orientation. The most important disaccharides are sucrose, lactose, and maltose. Sucrose consists of a molecule of α-glucose and a molecule of β-fructose linked together (Figure 2A).Two monosaccharide molecules may chemically bond to form a disaccharide. The name given to the covalent bond between the two monosaccharides is a glycosidic bond. Glycosidic bonds form between hydroxyl groups of the two saccharide molecules.Disaccharides. Disaccharides (di-= two) form when two monosaccharides join together via a dehydration reaction, also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis.Disaccharides form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (a condensation reaction); they are held together by a covalent bond. Sucrose (table sugar) is the most common disaccharide, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.Two monosaccharides undergo a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide. The bond that is formed after the condensation reaction is called glycosidic bonds. Examples of these condensation reactions are the formation of lactose from glucose and galactose, and the formation of sucrose from fructose and glucose.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharide units, linked by glycosidic bonds in the or orientation. The most important disaccharides are sucrose, lactose, and maltose. Sucrose consists of a molecule of -glucose and a molecule of -fructose linked together (Figure 2A).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Two monosaccharide molecules may chemically bond to form a disaccharide. The name given to the covalent bond between the two monosaccharides is a glycosidic bond. Glycosidic bonds form between hydroxyl groups of the two saccharide molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Disaccharides. Disaccharides (di-= “two”) form when two monosaccharides join together via a dehydration reaction, also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Disaccharides form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (a condensation reaction); they are held together by a covalent bond. Sucrose (table sugar) is the most common disaccharide, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Two monosaccharides undergo a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide. The bond that is formed after the condensation reaction is called glycosidic bonds. Examples of these condensation reactions are the formation of lactose from glucose and galactose, and the formation of sucrose from fructose and glucose.
